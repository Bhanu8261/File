6,Women and the Constitution
“There is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is,
improved. It is not possible for a bird to fly on only one wing”,
,Swami Vivekanand
,CONSTITUTION OF INDIA
Introduction,
The Constitution is the supreme law of the land and acts as a basic framework,
"to guide and govern the country. The Preamble of the Constitution, which has",
been described as the soul and is a reflection of the core constitutional values that,
embody the Constitution contains the objectives with which the country would,
function. The primary and most vital of which are the values of socio-economic-,
political “justice” and “equality” with regard to status and opportunities. To achieve,
"these goals, the State has to ensure that no discrimination of any kind is made",
"amongst people and that the rights of every citizen are safeguarded. Women, who",
"act as the cradle of human progress and civilization, have a significant and crucial",
"role to play in society. Therefore, they ought to be given equal representation in",
every aspect in the society.,
"The framers of the Constitution, after due deliberation on the position of the",
women in Indian society and the treatment meted out to them due to prevailing,
"social norms and customs in the past, tried to ensure that they are accorded the",
"requisite respect owed to them by society and in order to effectuate the same,",
"various provisions were incorporated in the Constitution. Time and again, the",
Hon’ble Courts have not only upheld the spirit of equality as enshrined in the,
constitution but have actively defended and vociferously advocated for the rights,
of women and made amendments to the impugned provisions or inadequate laws.,
"The Constitution of India not only grants basic human rights and equality to women,",
but also empowers the State to adopt measures of positive discrimination in favour,
"of women to guarantee social, economic, educational and political upliftment.",
"The Constitution guarantees the fundamental rights, enumerated in Part III en-",
"compassing Articles 12 to 35, which are applicable to all the citizens irrespective",
"of their sex and guarantees right to equality, freedom of speech and expression,",
"right against exploitation, freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights and",
"most importantly, right to constitutional remedies in order to effectuate and en-",
force the aforementioned rights. These provisions guarantee all the rights to women,
and men equally. Apart from guaranteeing equality before law and equal protec-,
"tion of law to women, there are certain affirmative rights provided under Articles",
"15, 16, etc. which empower the State to make special provisions for women.",
"The Directive Principles of State Policy, contained in Part IV of the Constitu-",
"tion, aim at ensuring socio economic justice and consists of all the ideals which the",
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
,Women and the Constitution,7
State should follow and keep in mind while formulating policies and enacting laws,,
"for the country. Some of the Directive Principles such as Articles 39 (a)(d), 42,",,
"and 45, direct the State to protect human rights of women including the right to",,
"equal pay for equal work, the right to health and work in hygienic conditions, the",,
right to maternity benefit and the right to gender justice respectively among many,,
other similar provisions.,,
"Further, the State has introduced reservations for women in various arenas:",,
"public employment, with regard to admissions in educational institutions and the",,
political representation among other schemes for their benefits. The Article 243 of,,
the Constitution of India deals with reservation of seats for women in Panchayats.,,

Women and the Constitution,9
OWhat do we mean by ‘equality before law for women’?,
Article 14 of the Constitution enshrines the concept of ‘equality before law for,
women’. This Article provides that State should not deny any person equality,
before the law and equal protection of law in India.,
"Every person, especially women, have been guaranteed equal opportuni-",
"ties and status irrespective of race, religion, social status, political influence,",
etc. Women are entitled to equal opportunities and status same as that ac-,
"corded to men, and any sort of discrimination against them on basis of gender",
is strictly prohibited. This right also includes equal pay for equal work for men,
and women.,
ｏWhat do we mean by prohibition of discrimination on grounds of,
"religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth?",
Article 15 casts a duty upon the State to ensure that no citizen shall be subject,
"to any restriction, condition or disability to access/enter shops, public spaces,",
"wells, tanks, ghats, roads, etc. which is maintained wholly or partially from State",
"funds intended for the general public on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or",
place of birth.,
"Further, the State has been granted special power under Article 15(3) to make",
special provisions for the women in certain situations for the larger interest of the,
community.,
ｏ Is there any provision under the Constitution of India for ensuring,
equal opportunity to women in public appointments?,
Yes. Article 16 of the Constitution provides for equal opportunities for all the,
citizens in matters of public appointment under the State. There shall be no dis-,
crimination whatsoever in matters pertaining to employment or appointment to,
"any office under the State against any citizen on the basis of gender, caste, race,",
"etc. Thus, every woman has a right to public employment as available to her",
malecounterpart and she cannot be denied the same only for the reason of her,
gender.,
ｏ What important rights are ensured by Article 19 of the Constitution,
of India?,
Article 19 of the Constitution of India provides a set of rights to the citizens,
which they may exercise subject to reasonable restrictions. These are divided into,

"tion, trade or business",
O What do you mean by ‘freedom of speech and expression’?,
Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India provides for freedom of speech,
"and expression, which is the foundation stone for a democratic setup.",
This is also considered as the first condition for liberty. Every citizen has com-,
"plete freedom, though subjected to certain reasonable restrictions as per Article",
"19 (2), to express herself/himself as per its opinions, freely by speaking, writing,",
"printing, pictures or any other mode whether in political, social or economic front.",
It is a much needed right of a woman as she had been suppressed by society to,
express herself freely.,
ｏ Is the right to assemble peacefully and form associations a funda-,
mental right?,
Yes. Article 19 (1)(b) of the Constitution provides the right to assemble peace-,
"ably, which includes the right to hold public meetings for education, religion, politi-",
"cal or social problems. Such an assembly should be unarmed, peaceful and must",
not be disruptive in nature as subject to restrictions under Article 19(1)(c) pro-,
"vides freedom to every citizen to form associations, unions or co-operative soci-",
eties. This is a freedom which ensures that political rights of people are also,
recognised along with common objectives. These freedoms are subject to restric-,
"tion under Article 19(4) that public order, morality, sovereignty and integrity of the",
nation is not compromised.,
ｏ What do we mean by ‘freedom of movement’?,

movement of citizens. The citizens have the right to move freely throughout the,
country and to reside in any part of the country which they like subject to basic,
restrictions under Article 19(5) and (6).,
This is a very essential right for women as they have always been re-,
stricted by families and societies to move freely. Freedom of movement also,
include right to travel abroad- A person has freedom to travel without re-,

strictions unless there is a procedure and due reason to restrict the same,
"[Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, AIR 1978 SC 597].",
OIs there any specific right under the Constitution regarding ‘free-,
dom of trade and profession’?,
Article 19(1)(g) provides guarantee to all the citizens to practice any profes-,
"sion, carry any occupation, trade or business. This is an economical guarantee to",
citizens which allows them to earn a livelihood as per their interests though subject,
to basic restrictions under Article 19(6).,
ｏWhat is ‘right to life and personal liberty’?,
Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees the right to life and personal liberty of,
the citizens of India. This Article has recognized a number of rights that includes,
"right to live with dignity, right to die with dignity, right to livelihood, right to clean",
"environment, etc.",
“Right to life” does not merely mean animal existence but means something,
"more, namely, the right to live with human dignity. It guarantees a life with dignity",
"that includes all the aspects of life which go to make a person’s life meaningful,",
complete and worth living.,
Dignity also includes protection from sexual harassment and right to work with,
dignity. A woman also has rights over her body and includes reproductive rights.,

"lance, right to be let alone, etc.",
＠Women’s Right to Make Reproductive Choices- It includes women’s right,
to refuse participation in the sexual activity or alternatively the insistence on,
the use of contraceptive methods such as undergoing sterilization proce-,
"dures women’s entitlement to carry a pregnancy to its full term, to give birth",
and subsequently raise children.,
＠ Right to travel abroad- A person has freedom to travel without restrictions,
unless there is a procedure and due reason to restrict the same.,
＠Right against illegal detention- The Supreme Court has laid down detailed,
guidelines to be followed by the Central and State investigating agencies in,
all cases of arrest and detention till legal provisions are made in that behalf as,
preventive measures.,
＠Right to speedy trial- Every person who is awaiting a trial has a fundamental,
right under Article 21 to speedy trial,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
12,Women and the Constitution
 Various rights have been read into Article 21 that includes pollution free en-,
"vironment, right to health, right to reputation, etc.",
ｏ Is the right to education a fundamental right?,
"The Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 inserted Article 21-A in",
the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education of all children,
in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right in such a manner,
"as the State may, by law, determine. The Right of Children to Free and Compul-",
"sory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, which represents the consequential legislation",
"envisaged under Article 21-A, means that every child has a right to full time el-",
ementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality in a formal school which,
satisfies certain essential norms and standards.,
ｏWhat does Article 22 of the Constitution of India deal with?,
Article 22 of the Constitution of India grants protection to the persons who are,
arrested or detained under the preventive detention law. This Article ensures the,
"right to know the grounds of arrest, legal aid, right to contact family members/",
relatives etc.,
ｏ What are the rights of arrested women?,
There are certain specific provisions regarding the rights of an arrested woman,
under the Criminal Procedure Code. These specific rights are inconsonance with,
Article 22 of the Constitution of India. Safety of the woman is the priority for the,
fair trial of the accused for ensuring there has been an amendment made in 2005 to,
"the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 mentioning an important point relating to",
women’s safety.,
"Section 46(4) of the Criminal Code governs the arrest of women, particularly",
"mentions that “unless there arises an exceptional circumstance, no woman can be",
"arrested before and after sunset, exceptional circumstances, no woman can be",
"arrested after sunset and before sunrise, during the prevail of such exceptional",
"circumstances a female constable shall by a writing report, must have secured",
consent of the Judicial Magistrate.,
ｏ What is ‘right against exploitation’?,
"Article 23 of the Constitution deals with the right against exploitation, it pro-",
"vides that all forms of trafficking in human beings, beggars and similar forms of",
"forced labour shall be prohibited, and any violation of this shall be an offence",
"punishable by law. In India, there used to be exploitation of forced bonded labour",
which was practiced by few sections of society resulting in exploitation of the,
under privileged. There were other forms of practices in India related to bonded,
"labour and human trafficking, which led to formulation of Article 23.",
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
Women and the Constitution,13
This Article specifically deals with the protection of women and girls against,
"exploitation in various forms. The age-old practices like devdasi, jogan, etc. were",
abolished. Article 23 ensures that protection to individuals is available not only,
against the State but also against private citizens.,
O What is ‘freedom of religion’?,
Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India ensure freedom of religion to,
every citizen in India. Article 25 guarantees every person the freedom of con-,
"science and hence every woman in India has the right to freely profess, practice",
and propagate any religion.,
ｏ Is excluding women from offering prayers in temple Constitu-,
tional?,
The temple’s practice of excluding women is unconstitutional. In Indian Young,
"Lawyers’ Association v. State of Kerala, it was held that the practice violated",
the fundamental right to freedom of religion - Article 25(1) of the Constitution-,
of female worshippers. Rule 3(b) allowed for Hindu denominations to exclude,
"women from public places of worship, if the exclusion was based on custom. It",
struck down Rule 3(b) of the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship Act as,
unconstitutional.,
ｏ Which Article/(s) of the Constitution of India deal with ‘cultural and,
educational rights’?,
"Under Article 29 and Article 30 of the Constitution of India, certain cultural and",
educational rights are guaranteed. Courts have resolved that sex is a foundation of,
classification and cannot in total be prohibited. Irrespective of being favourable or,
"unfavourable to women, certain special laws can be prepared in various kinds of",
cases.,
ｏ How can Fundamental Rights be enforced in Court?,
The fundamental rights which are the inviolable rights provided to all the citi-,
"zens, are enforceable through a specific set of provisions as provided under the",
Indian Constitution. Articles 32 and 226 provide the power to approach the Su-,
preme Court and High Court respectively for seeking the enforcement of funda-,
mental rights.,
Article 32 of Indian Constitution offers a remedy for the implementation of the,
"fundamental rights before the Supreme Court in the form of a Writ. Similarly,",

various High Courts in India.,

1. Air India v. Nargesh Meerza [AIR 1981 SC 1829],
The matter invoked the writ jurisdiction of Hon’ble Supreme Court and was,
previously filed before the National Industrial Tribunals (Khosla Tribunal (1965),
and the Mahesh Tribunal (1972)).,
The case dealt with the issue of discrimination on the basis of sex on multitude,
"of grounds such as promotional avenues, differential retirement ages, conditions",
pertaining to termination of the Air hostesses services in cases of pregnancy or,
marriage (premature retirement age as per regulation 46) and discretionary pow-,
ers of the Managing Director who under regulation 47 and were answered ques-,
tion pertaining to the aforementioned contentions.,
"Whether Regulations 46 & 47 are violative of Articles 14,15, 16 of the Consti-",
tution of India and thus ultra vires in whole or part? And whether discretionary,
powers as enumerated under Regulation 47 can be deemed as being excessive,
delegation?,
The Court held the aforementioned provisions regarding retirement and preg-,
nancy as unconstitutional and thus ordered for them to be struck down along with,
regulation 47 which was deemed an excessive delegation of powers without any,
reasonable guidelines to police the same.,
2. Ms. Githa Hariharan v. Reserve Bank of India [AIR 1999 SC 1149],
The application of the petitioner to the RBI for bonds to be held in the name of,
the minor son with her signatures as his guardian was sent back with the advisory,
to either produce the application signed by the father of child or produce a certifi-,
cate of guardianship from a competent authority in her favour. RBI was of the,
opinion that the father was the natural guardian of child on the basis of Section,
"6(a) of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 (HMGA). The provision",
stated that the father is the natural guardian of a Hindu minor child and the mother,
is the guardian “after” the father. Ms. Hariharan challenged the constitutional va-,
lidity of this provision in the Supreme Court on grounds that it violated the right to,
equality guaranteed under Articles 14 and 15 of the Indian Constitution.,
The Court held that both the father and mother are natural guardians of a minor,
"Hindu child, and the mother cannot be said to be natural guardian only after the",
death of the father as that would not only be discriminatory but also against the,
"welfare of the child, which is legislative intent of HMGA, 1956.",
The case established for the first time that a natural guardian referred to in the,
"HMGA, 1956 can be a father or a mother: whoever is capable of and available",
"for taking care of the child and is deeply interested in the welfare of the child, and",
that need not necessarily be the father.,

Rules regarding seniority and promotion in the Indian Foreign service were,

Sex were held to be violative of Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India.,
It was held that the Rules relating to seniority and promotion in Indian Foreign,
Service which make discrimination only on ground of sex is not only unconstitu-,
tional but also a hangover of the masculine culture of handcuffing the weaker sex.,
4. Ammini E.J. v. Union of India [AIR 1995 Ker 252],
"The constitutional validity of Section 10 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 which",
regulated divorce among Christians in India for a century and a quarter was di-,
"rectly challenge on the ground that the provisions in Section 10, so far as it makes",
adultery also necessary to be established along with cruelty and desertion as a,
"ground for divorce is arbitrary, authoritarian and violative of the fundamental rights",
guaranteed to them and other similarly situated Christian women under Articles,
"14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India.",
Referring to the life of a Christian wife being compelled to live as a wife against,
"her wish, the High Court of Kerala observed, “It will be a humiliating and op-",
pressed life without freedom to remarry and enjoy life in the normal course.,
It will be a life without Women’s Right and the Indian Constitution freedom to,
uphold the dignity of the individual in all respects. The Court quashed the im-,
"pugned provision as violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 and ruled that the wife may",
file for divorce only on the grounds of adultery without any other qualifying offence,
such as cruelty or desertion.,
5. Sheela Barse v. State of Maharashtra [AIR 1983 SC 378],
"In this case, a letter from Sheela Barse, a journalist complaining of custodial",
violence to women prisoners and the assault and torture which they were facing,
"from the police officers while confined in the police lock-ups in the city of Mumbai,",
was treated as a Writ Petition on the ground that a citizen has a right to know,
under the Articles 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Indian Constitution.,
"Simultaneously, the Director of the College of Social Work, Nirmala Niketan,",
was instructed to interview the women of Mumbai Central Jail who stated in her,
"report that, “all the allegations in the writ petition were true. Apart from this there",
was no proper system of providing legal assistance to female prisoners.,
"The court primarily dealt with safety and security of women prisoners, the fun-",
damental rights of the petitioner under Article 19(1)(a) and Article 21 and State’s,
liability to provide legal assistance to all prisoners in jails.,
The Supreme Court issued a notice to the Inspector of Jail to for ‘legal aid,
organisation’ at High Court and District levels. It was held that there should be,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
18,Women and the Constitution
separate lockups for female prisoners and it should be guarded by female police,
officers only. The Interrogation of the female prisoners should only be done in the,
presence of female officers only. The person should be informed about the grounds,
of arrest and provision of bail and it is mandatory that a female suspect is to be,
checked by a female police officer only (Section 160(1) of CrPC). Women pris-,
oners cannot be arrested after sunset and before sunrise.,
6. Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan [AIR 1997 SC 3011],
Bhanwari Dev and her husband were brutally attacked by five men for as re-,
venge for trying to stop the child marriage and was later gang-raped. The police,
avoided filing complaint due to which investigation and medical examination was,
delayed. The examiner did not mention any commission of rape in the report but,
rather mentioned the age of the victim. In the absence of sufficient evidence and,
"support from a local MLA, the accused were acquitted and subsequently a PIL",
was filed by a women’s rights group known as ‘Vishakha’. It laid its focus on the,
enforcement of the fundamental rights of women at the Workplace under the pro-,
"visions of Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India, it also raised the",
issue of the need for protection of women from sexual harassment at Workplace.,
The Supreme Court laid down guidelines to prevent sexual harassment of work-,
ing women in places of their work. Gender equality also includes protection from,
"any sort of sexual harassment and right to work with dignity. Hence, detailed",
"guidelines were laid down: Definition of workplace sexual harassment, Duty of the",
"employer to file a complaint, provide assistance to an aggrieved employee, pro-",
"vide a safe workplace environment and spread awareness, Constitution of a Com-",
plaint redressal committee and duty of government to widen the scope of these,
guidelines. The Vishakha guidelines were later on replaced by the Sexual Harass-,
"ment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act,",

7. T. Sudhakar Reddy v. Govt. of Andhra Pradesh [AIR 1994 SC 544],
Reservation of seats for women in local bodies and in educational institutions,
cannot be taken to mean as discrimination of ground of sex.,
The Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of proviso of the Andhra,
"Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act, 1964 and of the Rules framed there under",
relying upon the mandate of Article 15(3) of the Constitution providing for nomina-,
tion of two women members by the Registrar of the managing committee of the,
cooperative societies with a right to vote and to participate in the Committee’s meet-,
ing. The Supreme Court upheld the validity of these provisions on the ground that,
Article 15(3) of the Constitution permitted the making of special provisions for women.,

8. Babulal Parate v. State of Maharashtra [AIR 1961 SC 884],
"In this case, the constitutional validity of Section 144, Cr.P.C. was challenged",
for the first time.,
The dispute between two unions of textile workers which led to the imposition of,
Section 144 which was challenged in the court as being ultra vires the Constitution.,
The court while observing the right under Article 19(1)(b) of the Constitution of,
"India to assemble peaceably, hold public meetings and take out public processions",
"stated that “Public order has to be maintained in advance in order to ensure it and,",
"therefore, it is competent to a legislature to pass a law permitting an appropriate",
authority to take anticipatory action or place anticipatory restrictions on particular,
"kinds of acts in an emergency for the purpose of maintaining public order”,",
"The court, in its judgement, held that it would be wrong to regard the power",
under Section 144 as being unlimited or untrammeled and upheld the Constitu-,
tionality of the provision,
The provisions under Article 19 included the right to hold public meetings for,
"education, religion, political or social problems. Such an assembly should be un-",
"armed, peaceful and must not be disruptive in nature as subject to restrictions",
under Article 19(3) of the Constitution.,
9. Suchita Srivastava v. Chandigarh Administration [AIR 2010 SC 235],
"In this case, a 19-20 year old woman whose mental capacity was that of a 9-",
year-old girl became pregnant as a result of rape while living in government insti-,
tute for mentally retarded children.,
"The Punjab & Haryana High Court determined, without the woman’s consent, that",
it was in her best interests that the fetus should be aborted under Section 3 of the,
"Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 (MTP Act) as she did not have the",
"capacity to take care of a child, nor did she have a parent or guardian to look after her.",
"The Supreme Court stayed the order of the Punjab & Haryana High Court,",
and held that the right to reproductive choice flows from the right to liberty under,
Article 21 of the Constitution. It noted that taking away a woman’s choice regard-,
ing her own body would amount to infringement of her right to privacy. It further,
distinguished between mental illness and mental retardation and considered that,
the woman’s mental retardation did not take away her right to make a decision,
"regarding her reproductive choices. Therefore, it held that a termination of her",
pregnancy without her consent could not be ordered.,
“There is no doubt that a woman’s right to make reproductive choices is also a,
dimension of ‘personal liberty’ as understood under Article 21 of the Constitution,
of India. It is important to recognise that reproductive choices can be exercised to,
procreate as well as to abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration is that,
"a woman’s right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity should be respected. This",
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
20,Women and the Constitution
means that there should be no restriction whatsoever on the exercise of reproduc-,
tive choices such as a woman’s right to refuse participation in sexual activity or,
alternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive methods.”,
10. Vishal Jeet v. Union of India [AIR 1990 SC 1412],
The petitioner invoked the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme court under article,
32 and filed a PIL to seek directions for the establishment of a committee for,
inquiry against police officials under whose jurisdiction Forced Prostitution as well,
"as Devadasi system and Jogin traditions were flourishing, to rescue and rehabili-",
"tate inmates who are victims of flesh trade, to provide protective homes for chil-",
dren of victims and begging children.,
The issue before the Hon’ble court was whether the Supreme Court can issue,
guidelines or not?,
The court realized that measures to be taken in that regard should be more,
preventive rather than punitive. The Apex Court upheld the validity of Immoral,
"Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 and observed that trafficking in human beings has",
been prevalent in India for a long time in the form of selling and purchasing of,
human beings for prostitution for a price just like that of vegetables.,
"The enactment of the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women & Girls Act,",
1956 as per the provisions under Article 23 ‘Right against exploitation’ read along,
the Article 35 was brought about with the view to inhibit or abolish the immoral,
"traffic in women and girls. Besides the above Act, here are various provisions in",
the Indian Penal Code such as Sections 366-A (dealing with procuration of minor,
"girl), S. 366-B (dealing with an offence of importation of girl from a foreign coun-",
"try), S. 372 (dealing with selling of minor for purposes of prostitution, etc.) and S.",
"373 (dealing with the offence of buying minor for purposes of prostitution, etc.).",
"The Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 which provides for the care, protection, treatment,",
"development, and rehabilitation of neglected or delinquent juveniles contains a",
specific provision namely Section 13 which empowers a police officer or any,
other person or organization authorized by the State Government in this behalf to,
take charge of any neglected juveniles and bring them before the Board consti-,
tuted under this Act which Board under section 15 has to hold an inquiry and,
make such orders in relation to the neglected juveniles as it may deem fit in changed,
"as “The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956”",
"In the end, the Hon’ble Court directed the state as well as central government",
"to take appropriate measures, speedy trials, provisions of rehabilitation centres,",
advisory committees for making suggestions and valuable advice for the eradica-,
"tion of prostitution, devadasi system and jogin traditions, and proper implementa-",
"tion by the government on the suggestions of their respective committees, welfare",
"programs for the care, social welfare, protection, treatment development and re-",
habilitation of the victims and amendments in existing laws for prevention of sexual,
exploitation of children.,

PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO,
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 1,
Articles 14 and 15,
‘Seema’ and ‘Manish’ have been working as stenographers in a company. Both,
of them have the same work profile and the same working hours. Manish’s salary,
"is Rs 18,000 per month and ‘Seema’ earns Rs. 12,000 per month. ‘Seema’ ques-",
tioned her employer regarding the reason for unequal payment. The employer said,
"that as Manish is a man, he has better work efficiency.",
"In the above example, the contention of the employer is incorrect. Constitution",
of India strictly prohibits gender discrimination and right to equality is enshrined as,
a fundamental right in India. The act of the employer is also in violation of the,
"provisions of Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 which provides that men and women",
"workers must be paid equal remuneration for equal work. In this case, there is",
"discrimination on the basis of gender and hence, it is in violation of the provisions",
of the Constitution of India.,
‘Seema’ has a right to question and challenge the disparity in remuneration as,
‘equal pay for equal work’.,
****,
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 2,
Articles 14 and 21,
"‘Seema’ was married to ‘Manish’ however, both of them were separated and",
they were not in contact. ‘Seema’ applied for a post in a public organization. The,
prerequisite condition for applying to the post was the requirement of husband’s,
consent for wife’s application for public employment.,
"In the above example, the condition imposed for applying to the post is a dis-",
criminatory provision which gave advantages to men and imposed disabilities on,
women. It is an obstacle to women’s equality and economic justice. This job,
notification is in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution that specifically provides,
that right to equality is a fundamental right and Article 21 that provides freedom of,
a person or personal liberty.,
"In this case, ‘Seema’ has both the rights, she has the right to equality and per-",
sonal liberty to make her own decisions and she need not be dependent to seek,
permission of ‘Manish’ for the same.,

,Article 15
‘Manish’ challenged a service rule passed by a State that preferred women in,
recruitment to public employment to the extent of 30% of posts. His contention,
was that the said service rule is in violation of Article 15 of the Constitution that,
strictly prohibits discrimination on the ground of gender/sex.,
"In the above example, the contention of ‘Manish’ cannot be entertained as Article",
15(3) of the Constitution itself hints at a substantive approach. Its application for,
"giving special facilities to women in the educational field, for giving representation in",
local bodies and for protection in places of work has a substantive dimension that is,
to promote gender equality. Making special provision for women in respect of em-,
ployment or posts under the State is an integral Part of Article 15(3).,

PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 4,
‘Manish’ applied for an admission in an Engineering College. His admission,
was denied as he scored less marks than the passing criteria of that College. He,
argued with the College Authorities that his admission was denied not because of,
scoring less marks but due to reserved seats for women. He further contended,
that reservation of seats for women in a College is unconstitutional.,
"In the above example, the contention of ‘Manish’ is invalid. Reservation of some",
seats in a College for women is not unconstitutional and reservation of seats for,
women in an educational institution cannot be taken to mean as discrimination on the,
ground of sex and hence the same cannot hit by Article 15 of the Constitution.,

‘Seema’ is engaged by a Private Company and she demanded for the grant of,
maternity leave as she was six months pregnant. The Manager of the Company,
refused to grant the maternity leave to ‘Seema’ mentioning that Private Compa-,
nies are not bound to follow the laws regarding ‘maternity benefit’ to women.,
"In the above example, the contention of the Manager is baseless. As in India, a",
"woman has the fundamental right to dignity as a mother, and the maternity leave",
period is a part of the service period under the maternity policy in India. The,
maternity leave is social insurance. The maternity leave is given for maternal and,
child health and family support. If a woman who is pregnant is denied maternity,
leave even by a private company then it shall be in violation of fundamental rights,
of the woman and also in violation of the provisions of Maternity Benefit Act.,

“Socially sensitive juristic and economics must undergo qualitative change,
to put man at the centre of our plan of social transformation. This is the new,
"wave of thinking needed, if our society is to be on the move and not be frozen",
by orthodoxies of old rights and interests”,
,- Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer
DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY,
Introduction,
The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) embodied in Part IV of the,
Constitution contains certain obligations upon the State. The Directive Principles,
"according to the chief architect of the Indian Constitution Dr. B.R. Ambedkar,",
‘have a great value for they lay down that our ideal is economic democracy’.,
"Thus, the Constitutional ideal is not only political democracy but also economic",
democracy and the DPSPs strive to fulfil those ideals.,
"For achieving the socio-economic emancipation of women, the Constitution",
"has formulated the following principles. First, the discrimination is prohibited on",
"the ground of sex, secondly, it empowers the state to make special provisions for",
women with a view to enabling it to take special care of women in the light of their,
"peculiar physiological, psychological and social position. And, thirdly, the Direc-",
tive Principles give special directions to the state to do certain things in relation to,
women. These principles which constitute constitutional philosophy are incorpo-,
rated in the Constitution in the form of Fundamental rights and Directive Prin-,
"ciples. These are the instruments for attaining our national objectives of justice,",
liberty and equality.,
They are the instruments of instructions in the governance of the country. The,
main intention behind their inclusion in Part IV in the Constitution is that it may,
form a set of instructions issued to the prospective lawmakers and executives for,
their guidance for good governance. Part IV enjoys a very high place in the Con-,
stitutional scheme as it imposes obligations on the State to take positive actions for,
creating socio-economic conditions in order to bring about an egalitarian social,
order with social and economic justice to all.,
"To ignore Part IV is to ignore the substance provided for in the Constitution, the",
hopes held out to the Nation and the very ideals on which our Constitution is built.,
"Without faithfully implementing the Directive Principles, it is impossible to achieve",
the Welfare Stateas contemplated by the Constitution.,
The framers of the Constitution bestowed sufficient time on contemplation of,
"thoughts on the position of women in the Indian social order, which is quite evident",
from the provisions of the Constitution. There are a number of directives which,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
,Women and the Constitution,31
show concern for women and children in order to ensure equal justice. A plain,,
reading to these Articles would show the extensive analysis undertaken by the,,
framers in covering almost all the matters including the issues pertaining to labour,,
jurisprudence. They also clarify that the Constitution intended to provide protec-,,
,1,
"tion to the workers who were not given a fair deal by the society so far, which also",,
include women workers.,,
Directive Principles of State Policy embodies the major policy goals of a wel-,,
"fare state, while some of the Directive Principles are primarily “women specific”,",,
others concern indirectly or by necessary implication. The Articles that concern,,
"women directly and have a special bearing on their status include Articles 38, 39",,
"(a) (d), 42, 44 and 45.",,

32,Women and the Constitution
OWhat steps are taken by the State to secure adequate means of,
livelihood for both men & women?,
"Article 39, by virtue of clause (a) further casts an obligation upon the State to",
"direct its policy towards securing to all the citizens, including men and women",
"equally, the right to adequate means of livelihood. Equal pay for equal work is one",
"such directive principle, enshrined in Article 39(d), which provides that the State",
shall direct its policy towards ensuring that there is equal pay for equal work for,
both men and women. The doctrine of ‘equal pay for equal work’ was propounded,
as a part of the Directive Principles. The fundamental rights relevant to Article,
"39(d) are Articles 14 and 16, which pertain to equal protection of laws and equal-",
ity in matters of public employment respectively.,
ｏ How is the implementation of equal remuneration to workers of,
both sexes done by the State?,
To implement the Directive Principles contained in Article 39 (d) and to meet,
"out the problems in payment of wages, the Parliament enacted Equal Remunera-",
"tion Act, 1976 with an intention to eliminate discrimination in payment of wages",
and to ensure equal remuneration to workers of both the sexes for doing same or,
similar nature of work.,
ｏ What are the remedies available against economic exploitation of,
women under the Directive Principles of State Policy?,
The principles enshrined in Article 38 along with the provisions in Article 39(b),
fulfils the basic purpose of securing and protecting as effectively as it may the,
"social order in which justice, social, economic and political welfare of people are",
ensured along with restructuring the economic order and undertaking steps to,
"distribute the entire material resources of the community, withbest interests to serve",
the common good.,
ｏ Whether the opportunities for securing justice are ensured by the,
State for the Citizens?,
"Article 43 provides that the State shall endeavour to secure to all workers, men",
"and women, a living wage and a decent standard of life. Another very important",
Article of the Directive Principles of State Policy aims at ending the regime of,
personal and regional laws: “the State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a,
"uniform civil code throughout the territory of the India. In addition to this, the",
provisions of Article 39-A secure that the operation of the legal system promotes,
"justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal",
"aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportu-",
nities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or,

Women and the Constitution,33
O What are the provisions for protection of Legal Rights under Article,
39-A?,
Article 39-A of the Constitution provides that the State shall secure that the,
"operation of the legal system promotes justice on the basis of equal opportunity,",
"and shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or",
"in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to",
any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities.,
"ｏ What is the contribution of the Legal Service Authorities Act, 1987",
in protecting the interest of weaker sections of the society?,
"The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 was enacted to constitute legal ser-",
vices authorities for providing free and competent legal services to the weaker,
sections of the society to ensure that opportunities for securing justice were not,
denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities and to organize,
Lok Adalats to ensure that the operation of the legal system promoted justice on a,
"basis of equal opportunity. The system of Lok Adalat, which is an innovative mecha-",
"nism for alternate dispute resolution, has proved effective for resolving disputes in",
a spirit of conciliation outside the courts and has proven to be imperative mean to,
reduce the huge pendency in the justice system of the country.,
ｏ Whether women are entitled to the right to work with dignity?,
"Yes, women are also entitled to the right to work with dignity. Article 41 pro-",
"vides that within the limits of its economic capacity and development, the state",
shall make effective provision to secure the right to work as fundamental with just,
and human conditions of work by suitable legislation or economic organization. In,
"any other way in which the worker shall be assured of living wages, conditions of",
work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and,
cultural opportunities to the workmen.,
ｏ Which are the Social Welfare Schemes undertaken by the Govern-,
ment of India?,
The Social Welfare schemes undertaken by the Government of India in the lines,
of Article 41 are enumerated below:,
a) Labour and Employment Scheme Employment Assurance Scheme,(EAS)
b) Food for Work Programme,
c) Jawahar Rozgar Yojana,
d) Labour Welfare Fund,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
34,Women and the Constitution
e) Maternity Benefits Scheme,
f) Million Wells Scheme,
"g) Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005",
h) Prime Minister’s Rozgar Yojana (PMRY),
i) Rural Employment Generation Programme(REGP),
j) Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY),
k) Scheme for Working Women Hostels,
l) Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labourers,
m) Support to Training and Employment Programme for Women (STEP),
n) Swarnjayanti Gram SwarozgarYojana(SGSY),
o) Training of Rural Youth for Self- Employment (TRYSEM),
O Whether there is any provision for securing just and humane condi-,
tions of work and for maternity relief?,
Women who constitute almost half of the segment of our society have to be,
honoured and treated with dignity at places where they work to earn their liveli-,
"hood. Whatsoever be the nature of their duties, their avocation and the place",
where they work; they must be provided all the facilities to which they are entitled.,
Article 42 directs the State to make provisions for securing just and humane con-,
ditions of work and for maternity relief. The State has implemented this directive,
"by incorporating health provisions in the Factories Act, Maternity Benefit Act,",
"Beedi and Cigar Workers (Conditions of Employment) Act, etc.",
"ｏ What is the aim behind enactment of The Maternity Benefit Act,",
1961?,
"The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 aims to provide all these facilities to a working",
woman in a dignified manner so that she may overcome the state of motherhood,
"honourably, peaceably, undeterred by the fear of being victimised for forced ab-",
sence during the pre or post-natal period. Since Article 42 specifically speaks of,
"“just and humane conditions of work” and “maternity relief, the validity of an ex-",
ecutive or administrative action in denying maternity benefit has to be examined on,
"the anvil of Article 42 which, though not enforceable at law, is nevertheless avail-",
able for determining the legal efficacy of the action complained of.,
ｏHow the women is protected against the Sexual Harassment at work-,
place?,
"The enactment of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013",
gives you the right to file a complaint against sexual harassment. The law enables a,
sexually harassed woman employee can put in a written complaint to an Internal,
Complaints Committee (ICC) at a branch office within a period of 3 months as,
per the Sexual Harassment Act. This complaint further is taken up by the Local,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
Women and the Constitution,35
"Complaints Committee (LCC) at a district level, ensuring investigations start re-",
garding the same if proper action has not been taken against the employer. The,
complaint can also be filed by any of the woman’s legal heirs on her behalf or any,
other person who has written permission given by her to make the complaint.,
O What are the initiatives taken by the State to secure and ensure a,
decent standard of life by workers?,
Article 43 of the Constitution deals with the issue of living wage.Wherein it,
"strives to ensure through the directive principle that the State shall endeavour, inter",
"alia, to secure by suitable legislation or economic organization or in any other way,",
"to all workers, agricultural, industrial or otherwise, work a living wage condition of",
work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and,
cultural opportunities.,
The idea is that every worker shall have a wage which will maintain him in the,
"highest state of industrial efficiency, which will enable him to provide for his family",
"with all the material things which are necessary for their health and physical wellbeing,",
enough to enable him to qualify to discharge his duties as a citizen. The amount of,
living wage in money terms will vary among different types of trading activities.,
ｏ Which steps are taken to ensure participation of workers in man-,
agement of undertakings or establishments?,
Article 43A states that the State shall take steps by suitable legislation or in any,
other way to secure the participation of workers in the management of undertak-,
"ings, establishments or other organizations engaged in any industry. The constitu-",
tional mandate is therefore clear and unambiguous with regard to the management,
of the enterprise and that it should not be left entirely in the hands of the suppliers,
of capital but the workers should also be entitled to participate in it.,
Article 43A of the Constitution requires the State to take steps to secure the,
"participation of workmen in the management, undertaking and establishments of",
"organizations engaged in any industry. Thus, from being a factor of production, the",
labour has become a partner in industry. It is a common venture inthe pursuit of a,
desired goal.,
ｏWhat is the contribution of Uniform Civil Code in recognizing the rights,
of women in India?,
The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout,
the territory of India. Article 44 directs the State to secure for citizens a Uniform,
Civil Code applicable throughout the territory of India. Its particular goal is to-,
wards the achievement of gender justice.,
Even though the State has not yet made any efforts to introduce a Uniform Civil,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
36,Women and the Constitution
"Code in India, the judiciary has recognized the necessity of uniformity in the appli-",
"cation of civil laws relating to marriage, succession, adoption, divorce, mainte-",
"nance, etc.",
O How is the right of free education for children ensured by the,
State?,
"Article 45 makes provision for free and compulsory education for children,",
which is now well settled as a fundamental right to the children up to the age of 14,
years; it also mandates that facilities and opportunities for higher educational av-,
enues be provided to them. Social justice and economic empowerment are firmly,
held as fundamental rights of every citizen.,
"The 86th Constitution Amendment Act, 2002 added Article 21A to the Consti-",
tution which requires the State to provide free and compulsory education to all,
children from the age of six to 14 years.,
ｏ What are the measures undertaken by the State for the improve-,
ment of public health?,
"According to Article 47, it is the Duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition",
and the standard of living and to improve public health. The State shall regard the,
raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the,
"improvement of public health as among its primary duties and, in particular, the",
State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for,
medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health.,
The makers of the Constitution refer both to the goal of health of the public and,
the attending promotion of healthy practices.,

,LANDMARK JUDGMENTS
"1. Unni Krishnan, J.P. &Ors. v. State of Andhra Pradesh &Ors. [AIR",
1993 SC 217],
The case involved a challenge by certain private professional educational facili-,
ties to the constitutionality of state laws regulating capitation fees charged by such,
institutions.,
The Supreme Court held that the right to basic education is implied by the,
fundamental right to life (Article 21) when read in conjunction with the directive,
principle on education (Article 41). The Court held that the parameters of the right,
"must be understood in the context of the Directive Principles of State Policy, in-",
"cluding Article 45 which provides that the state is to endeavor to provide, within a",
"period of ten years from the commencement of the Constitution, for free and",
compulsory education for all children under the age of 14. The Court ruled that,
there is no fundamental right to education for a professional degree that flows from,
"Article 21. It held, however, that the passage of 44 years since the enactment of",
the Constitution had effectively converted the non-justiciable right to education of,
children under 14 into one enforceable under the law. After reaching the age of,
"fourteen, their right to education is subject to the limits of economic capacity and",
development of the state (as per Article 41).,
2. Occupational Health and Safety Association v. Union of India & oth-,
ers [AIR 2014 SC 1469],
The petitioner was a non-profit organization committed towards the health and,
safety of workers and represented about 130 Coal Fired Thermal Power Plants,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
Women and the Constitution,39
(CFTPP). The predominant concern was the lack of a system for occupational,
safety or safeguards from health hazards in such industries. They invoked the ju-,
"risdiction of the Supreme Court through Article 32, seeking a direction of manda-",
mus to frame guidelines for occupational safety and health regulations. They also,
sought the establishment of a Committee to monitor the working of thermal power,
"plants, and maintain a check on the health and well-being of its workers while",
providing compensation.,
An interlocutory application was filed by the petitioner respectively one in the,
year 2005 and the other one in the year 2007 where the serious health issues were,
highlighted for the workers who were working in different power plants and were,
suffering for years. Petitioners submitted a report which indicated that most of the,
"workers were suffering from pulmonary function test abnormalities, lung function",
"abnormalities, skin diseases, asthama and so on.",
The right to health and medical care of workmen has been viewed as a funda-,
mental right and decided the right to come under Article 21 of the Constitution,
"when read with Articles 39(e), 41, 43 & 48-A. The decision in Consumer Educa-",
tion & Research Centre and others v. Union of India &Ors. held that the compul-,
sion of the workman to work in such a hazardous industry ought not to be misused,
to forsake one’s health and vigour.,
The Division bench penned that CFTPPs were spread all over the country and,
it would not be practicable for the Supreme Court to examine whether the stan-,
dards were being complied with at each such industry. The Court thus deemed it,
appropriate to assign these issues to High Courts in whose jurisdictions the plants,
"were functioning, to examine them in-depth withthe aid and assistance of the re-",
spective State Governments and CFTPPs. It would be the role of respective High,
Courts to examine whether there were effective health delivery mechanisms and,
periodic evaluation of workers’ health.,
"In conclusion, The Division Bench ordered for a copy of the judgment to be",
forwarded to the Chief Justices of 18 High Courts to initiate suo motu proceed-,
ings in larger interests of workers.,
3. Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Female workers (muster roll) [AIR,
2000 SC 1274],
The Municipal Corporation of Delhi granted maternity leave only to its regular,
female employees and not to the muster-roll women employees of the Corpora-,
tion. The Muster roll employees claimed maternity benefits under the Act. The,
"Supreme Court while granting the benefits held that “A woman employee, at the",
time of advanced pregnancy cannot be compelled to undertake hard labour as it,
would be detrimental to her health and also to the health of the foetus. It is for this,
reason that it is provided in the Act that she would be entitled to maternity leave,
for certain periods prior to and after delivery. There is nothing contained in the Act,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
40,Women and the Constitution
which entitles only regular women employees to the benefit of maternity leave and,
not to those who are engaged on casual basis or on muster roll on daily-wage,
basis.”,
"It is in the background of the provisions contained in Articles 39, specially 42",
and 43 that the claim of the respondents for maternity benefit and the action of the,
petitioner in denying that benefit has to be scrutinized. Since Article 42 specifically,
speaks of “just and humane conditions of work” and “maternity relief” the validity,
of an executive or administrative action in denying maternity benefit has to be,
"examined on the anvil of Article 42 which though, not enforceable at law, is never-",
theless available for determining the legal efficacy of the action complained of.,

"“Empowerment of women leads to development of a good family, good",
"society and, ultimately, a good nation.”",
,- Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam
,FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES
Introduction,
According to a report prepared by India’s National Crime Records Bureau,
"(NCRB), one bride was murdered every hour over dowry demands in 2010, a",
crime has been recorded against women every three minutes in India. Every 60,
"minutes, two women are raped in this country. Every six hours, a young married",
"woman is found beaten to death, burnt, or driven to suicide. India ranks the worst",
among G-20 countries with respect to its treatment of women. The list of atrocities,
"against women is so long that we will be exhausted even talking about it. Thus, it is",
imperative to rise above the degenerations and deviations that had set in in later,
"periods and restore the times in which women were regarded with highest honour,",
"dignity and respect. The Constitution of India, through Article 51A, makes it a Fun-",
damental Duty of every citizen of the country to abide by the Constitution and re-,
"spect its ideals and institutions of respecting women, ensuring their dignity and work-",
ing actively towards safeguarding the interests of women. An individual is the funda-,
mental organ of a State and each organ is required to work unitedly to achieve the,
means of a welfare State. Even if the government is trying to take care of this natural,
"right by formulating various policies, enacting and legislating laws, these are not enough",
to tackle the problems concerning women’s security unless the same is backed by a,
change in social values and perception as an effective implementation in reality can,
only be achieved if the society is willing to adopt that change and actively work,
towards the achievement of said goals and for this reason a strong move to protect,
the rights of women needs to be led by people engaging of the entire humanity.,
Gender injustice is a problem that is seen all over the world. But unless there are,
"certain attitudinal changes, the women’s right and constitutional values shall remain a",
"far-fetched dream, promising an egalitarian society yet failing on delivering the same",
in practicality. What are the fundamental duties?,
The fundamental duties are a few basic statutory dutiesor moral obligations,
upon the citizens however they are not legally enforceable by law as of now but a,
court may take them into account while adjudicating on a matter. They were in-,
"corporated through 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, on the recommendation of Swaran",
"Singh Committee. Being an Indian citizen, certain rights and duties are provided to",
us. As explained by the Supreme Court in the Ramlila Maidan Incident v.,
"Home Secretary, 2012 AIR SCW 3660, “the word “fundamental” is used in",
two separate senses in our Indian Constitution. When this word is used for rights,
then it means that these rights are very essential and any law which will violate the,
fundamental rights will be declared as void. But when this word is used for the,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
,Women and the Constitution,49
duties then it is used in a normative sense as it sets certain goals before the state,,
which the state should try to achieve.” These duties are for every citizen to abide,,
by the laws and perform his/her legal obligations.,,
OWhat are the various fundamental duties provided under Article,,
51A?,,
The various fundamental duties are:,,
Sub-,Duties,
clauses,,
a.,To abide by the Indian Constitution and respect its ideals and institu-,
,"tions, the National Flag and the National Anthem.",
b.,To Cherish and follow the noble ideals that inspired the national struggle,
,for freedom.,
c.,"To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India.",
d.,To defend the country and render national service when called upon to,
,do so,
e.,To promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst,
,"all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or",
,sectional diversities and to renounce practices derogatory to the dig-,
,nity of women,
f.,To value and preserve the rich heritage of the country’s composite,
,culture,
g.,"To protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes,",
,"rivers, and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures",
h.,"To develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry",
,and reform,
i.,To safeguard public property and to abjure violence,
j.,To strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective,
,activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour,
,and achievement,
k.,To provide opportunities for education to his child or ward between,

O What is the scope of fundamental duties?,
The Fundamental duties are obligatory in nature.In AIIMS Students Union v.,
"AIIMS, it was held that Fundamental Duties though not enforceable by writ of the",
"court, yet provide a valuable guide and aid to interpretation of constitutional and",
legal issues. Their scope can be determined through following important points:,
＠They were incorporated to remind Indian Citizens of their duty towards their,
"society, fellow citizens and the nation, be mindful of nation’s interest, and social",
"values, inspire citizens and promote a sense of discipline and commitment among",
them.,
＠Any ambiguous statute can be interpreted with the help of fundamental duties.,
＠ The court can consider the law reasonable if it gives effect to any of the,
"fundamental duties. In this way, the court can save such law from being declared",
as unconstitutional,
ｏWhat are the features of fundamental duties?,
"＠FewFundamental rights are available to foreign nationals as well; however,",
the fundamental duties are only restricted to the Indians citizens.,
＠The Fundamental duties have been demarcated further into moral duties and,
civic duties in order to cherish the noble ideals of freedom struggle and simulta-,
"neously and respect the Constitution, National Flag and National Anthem. The",
"fundamental duties are not legally enforceable in nature i.e., without any legal sanc-",
tion in case of their violation or non-compliance. The Fundamental duties lay down,
certain responsibilities and duties to be followed by a citizen in order to respect,
"and promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood, transcending the",
"barriers of religion, language, etc. and uphold the spiritual values of the nation.",
ｏAre the fundamental duties enforceable in the Court of Law?,
"No, but though these Duties are not themselves enforceable in the Courts nor",
"their violation, as such, punishable, nevertheless, a court may take them into ac-",
count while adjudicating on a matter and also while determining constitutionality of,
a law.,
ｏIs there any fundamental duty for the protection of women?,
"Yes, Article 51A(e) enjoins upon every citizen to renounce practices deroga-",
tory to the dignity of women. Our natural obligation to renounce practices deroga-,
tory to the dignity of women has been elevated to the status of fundamental duty,
by the said article.,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
Women and the Constitution,51
O Are there any specific enactments for the betterment of women which,
owe their existence to the provisions of Fundamental Duties?,
"Yes, there are various enactments of the Government which punish practices",
derogatory to the dignity of women and owe their existence to the provisions of,
Fundamental Duties. Some of them are:,
"＠ The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976,",
"＠ The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961,",
"＠The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 and",
"＠The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956",
LANDMARK JUDGMENTS,
1. Mr. Vijay Sharma and Mrs. Kirti Sharma v. Union of India [AIR 2008,
Bom 29],
"The petition was filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, whereby",
"the constitutional validity of Sections 2, 3A, 4(5), and 6(c) of the Preconception",
"and Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994 was",
challenged.,
The petitioners had two female children and wanted a third child who was,
male. Their main contention was that they do not intend to misuse the act. As they,
"already have two female children, they only want to balance their family by bring-",
"ing a brother to their two female children. According to the petitioners, the married",
couples who have one male or one female child should be allowed to select the,
sex of the second child. The Bombay High Court denied such permission and,
stated the following:,
1. There is a severe imbalance of male to female ratio in Indian society;,
2. The society does not want a girl child;,
3. The society has preference over a male child over a girl child;,
4. Such a tendency to allow artificial techniques is the primary factor of the,
dwindling male to female ratio.,
5. Such practices are derogatory and offend the dignity of women;,
"6. It ignores Article 51A(e) of the Constitution, which states that it shall be",the
duty of every citizen of India to renounce practices derogatory to the,dignity of
women.,
2. Rajendra Prasad v. Allahabad High Court and another [1998 All LJ,
2380],
It was held that committing an offence under sections 304B and 498A amounted,
to “moral turpitude.” It is the fundamental duty of every citizen “to renounce prac-,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
52,Women and the Constitution
tices derogatory to the dignity of women” as per Article 51A of the Constitution.,
3. Indian Young Lawyers Association v. State of Kerala [The Sabarimala,
Case] [AIR 2018 SC (Supp) 1650],
The Ayyappa temple in Sabarimala region in Kerala has the provision of re-,
stricting entry of women of menstruating age (10-15 years of age) into Sabarimala,
"Temple, Kerala.",
"In this case, there were many issues raised in which it was argued by petition-",
ers that provisions related to the restriction of women entry in temples are uncon-,
"stitutional as it violates Articles 14, 15, 17, 25, 26 of the Indian Constitution.the",
practice of excluding women from the temple at Sabarimala is not an essential,
religious practice. The Court must decline to grant constitutional legitimacy to prac-,
tices which derogate from the dignity of women and to their entitlement to equal,
citizenship. It is against Article 51A (e) of the Constitution.,
A 4:1 majority held that the temple’s practice of excluding women is unconsti-,
tutional. It held that the practice violated the fundamental right to freedom of reli-,
"gion, Article 25(1) of female worshippers. It struck down Rule 3(b) of the Kerala",
Hindu Places of Public Worship Act as unconstitutional. Rule 3(b) allowed for,
"Hindu denominations to exclude women from public places of worship, if the",
exclusion was based on ‘custom’.,
A review petition in the case was filed before the constitutional bench which,
referred the matter further to a nine-Judge Bench. In addition to the sabrimala,
"issue, the nine-Judge Bench would examine larger issues of law like the prohibi-",
tion of women from entering mosques and temples to genital mutilation among,
DawoodiBohras and the banning of Parsi women who married inter-faith from,
entering the fire temple.,

,PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 1,
"According to a religious sect, there is a ritual (puja) which can only be",
done by men above 12 years of age. The ritual consists of rotating a thali,
"(plate), which contains a lighted incense stick and chanting mantra (hymns).",
"For years, the ritual has only been done by men of the family. Women are",
strictly not allowed to conduct the ritual. Two women of the sect filed a PIL,
against such a ritual. What can the decision of the Court be?,
Answer: Such practices are against Article 51A (e) of the Constitution of India.,
The facts of the case are actually similar to Sabarimala’s judgment. The letter and,
spirit of the Constitution must always prevail over superstitious and discriminatory,
practices of any religion.,
,****
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 2,
The Ministry of Home Affairs recently issued a notification by which all,
the bar dancing and the related activities shall be banned entirely. What is,
the validity of such a notification?,
Answer: The Government cannot issue such an order stating that it is violative,
of Article 51A (e) of the Constitution. Bar dancing in no way is derogatory against,
women. There have been many Supreme Court judgments on this point. The re-,
"cent trend of the Supreme Court has been pro-feminism, and the scope of what",
"practices are derogatory and what is not has changed. Therefore, the Government",
cannot pass such an order. It may regulate the same by-passing guidelines.,

WOMEN AND THE CONSTITUTION -,
,CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES
INTRODUCTION,
A very significant aspect of the Constitution of India is the jurisdiction it confers,
on the Supreme Court and the High Courts to issue writs in case of violation of,
"any fundamental right. In fact, this provision of ‘Constitutional remedy’ has been",
described as ‘Heart and Soul’ of the Indian Constitution by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar.,
The writs have been among the great safeguards provided by the Constitution for,
upholding the rights and liberties of the people. The expression ‘prerogative writ’,
"refers to the extraordinary writs granted by the Sovereign, as fountain of justice,",
on the ground of inadequacy of original legal remedies.,
High Courts have powers under Article 226 and the Supreme Court has the,
similar power provisioned under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. When the,
"laws are inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights, which are",
"conferred by Part III of the Constitution, they shall be declared void as per judge-",
"ment and analysis of the courts, the Courts have the power to adjudge the Consti-",
tutional validity of all laws.,
Article 32 provides the right to an individual to directly approach the Supreme,
Court for enforcement of fundamental rights invoking Writ Jurisdiction of the Su-,
"preme Court. Furthermore, the writs are generally summoned against the state",
and are issued when PILs are recorded. The Writ Jurisdiction which are pre-,
"sented by the Constitution, however, have privilege controls and are optional in",
"nature but then they are unbounded in its breaking points. The carefulness, in any",
"case, is practiced on legitimate standards.",
"Hence, obviously immense forces are vested with the Judiciary to control a",
managerial activity when it encroaches fundamental privileges of the subjects or,
"when it goes past the soul of Grundnorm of our nation i.e., Constitution of India. It",
guarantees the Rule of Law and appropriate check and equalizations between the,
three organs of our democracy operating ona vote-based framework. The ratio-,
nality of writs is very much synchronized in our Constitutional arrangements to,
guarantee that privileges of nationals are not smothered by a self-assertive au-,
thoritative or Judicial activity.,

LANDMARK JUDGMENTS,
"1. Hussainara Khatoon v. Home Secretary, State of Bihar [AIR 1979",
SC 1369],
The present case is a landmark judgment on the speedy trial of cases that came,
to be recognized as a fundamental right of every accused person. It is a facet of,
the rightful administration of justice. The Constitutional obligation upon the State,
to undertake the protection of rights of individuals under Article 21 is inclusive of,
the duty to ensure there is a speedy trial of cases. It also ensures the right to access,
free legal services to the poor as an essential part of Article 21 of the Constitution.,
The writ petition was filed before the Court for the hearing of the release of,
under-trial prisoners in the state of Bihar. The state of Bihar was directed to file a,
revised chart showing a year wise break-up of the under-trial prisoners after di-,
viding into two broad categories viz. minor offenses and major offenses that were,
not carried out.,
The Court directed the under-trial prisoners whose names and particulars were,
given in the list filed by Mrs. Hingoranito should be released forthwith as continuance,
of their detention is illegal and in violation of their fundamental right under Article 21,
of the Constitution because they have been in jail for a duration exceeding the maxi-,
mum term that they should have been convicted for. The Court also realized the,
"plight of under-trial prisoners who are for most times, unaware of their right to obtain",
"release on bail or due to poverty, are unable to engage a lawyer. For this, the need",
for an adequate and comprehensive legal service program was called for.,
2. Dr. Upendra Baxi And Ors. (I) v. State of U.P. And Ors. [AIR 1987 SC,
191],
The case is related to a Protective Home in Agra where abandoned women,
"and girl children were kept, leading inhuman life to the extent of having no clothes",
to wear. Some of them were suffering from diseases and were being kept along,
"with the healthy girls. Moved by these pathetic conditions two law professors,",
"Upendra Baxi and Lothika Sarkar of Delhi University filed a PIL, seeking court’s",
directions to the State Government to protect the basic human rights of the in-,
mates of the protective home at Agra which was established under the provisions,
of the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act 1956.,
The Supreme Court through Justice Bhagwati made an order giving various,
directions in order to ensure that the inmates of the Protective Home at Agra,
do not continue to live in inhuman and degrading conditions and that the right,
to live with dignity enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution is made real and,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,

meaningful for them. He gave certain directions to the State government run-,
"ning the home, on the treatment meted out to the girl children and women in",
"the Home and with regard to the adequate toilet facilities, hospital facilities",
and for providing proper clothing to the inmates.,
3. People’s Union for Democratic Rights and Others v. Union of India &,
Others [AIR 1982 SC 1473],
"In this case, a complaint was filed alleging violation of Article 24 of the Consti-",
tution (which prohibits employing children below the age of 14 years in hazardous,
employment) on behalf of child labourers employed in construction work in Delhi.,
"Working at a feverish pace, often far beyond the working hours fixed by laws",
"without the minimum daily wages due to them living in hovels, the children dying of",
"malnutrition frequently becoming victims of accidents, these workers were forced",
to complete the ASIAD projects in time. The terrible working and living condi-,
tions to which these workers were subjected were first brought to public notice by,
a fact-finding team of the People’s Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR) which,
visited some of the major sites and interviewed the workers as well as their em-,
ployers.,
The People’s Union for Democratic Rights followed this up by filing a,
"writ petition before the Supreme Court on November 16, 1981, by way of",
PIL in order to issue observance of the provisions of various labour laws in,
relation to the workers employed in the construction work of the ASIAD-,
82 projects.,
The court by its decision upheld the right of a poor worker to directly,
approach the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India,
for the enforcement of rights created under various labour laws and particu-,
larly under the provisions of Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition),
"Act, 1970, Interstate Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and",
"Conditions of Service) Act, 1977, Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, Employ-",
"ment of Children Act, 1970 and Minimum Wages Act, 1948. The Supreme",
Court extended the scope of the meaning of Article 21 of the Constitution,
(right to life) to include the right to livelihood along with the ‘right to live with,
basic human dignity’.,
4. Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India &Ors. [AIR 1984 SC,
802],
The petitioner Bandhua Mukti Morcha is an NGO which works for the,
"welfare of the people. While they were conducting a survey, they found some",

Women and the Constitution,73
stone quarries in Faridabad where the workmen were operating in extremely,
dangerous situations. The working conditions were very unhygienic and un-,
suitable for these workers who had come from different parts of the country,
to work here.,
The petitioner wrote a letter to Justice Bhagwati regarding the workplace and,
working conditions of those workmen. This letter was taken as a writ petition,
under Article 32 of the constitution and a commission was made to enquire about,
the allegations put forth by the petitioner. The allegations were proved right as per,
the findings of the commission and there was infringement of the rights of the,
labourers.,
"In the judgment, the Court discussed the importance of protecting children’s",
"rights to education, health, and development in ensuring India’s progress as a",
democracy. While recognizing that child labor could not be abolished immedi-,
"ately due to economic necessity, the Court found that pragmatic steps could be",
taken to protect and promote the rights of children in the poverty-stricken and,
vulnerable populations of Indian society.,

Anjali was recruited as a subject expert under Zilla Parishad School Wardha,
from women category. It was specifically mentioned under the appointment letter,
"that she was appointed for Wardha only. But after a few years of her joining,",
Government declared it as surplus and she along with some other employees trans-,
ferred to Jalgaon. But one year later she came to know that there a post vacant in,
Wardha and she applied for transfer as she had a very small baby and her mother,
in law was not well. In the meanwhile a male candidate got transferred to Wardha,
and Anjali’s transfer application was dismissed. What remedy is available with,
Anjali?,
Anjali is appointed under women category and in her appointment letter it is,
specifically mentioned that she is appointed for Wardha only. But she was trans-,
ferred to Jalgaon. Anjali can file a writ petition under Article 226 to the High,
Court for issuance of transfer order in her favour under the writ of Mandamus.,

‘Seema’ who is employed as a teacher in a privately managed aided school in,
the State of Haryana. She was paid less salary and dearness allowance as paid to,
the teachers employed in Government Schools. She challenged it by filing a Writ,
Petition. It was contended by the Authorities that ‘equal pay for equal work’ is not,
a fundamental right and hence a writ petition cannot be filed.,
"In the above example, the contention of the authorities is incorrect and base-",
"less. The principle of ‘equal pay and equal work’, though not a fundamental right,",
"is certainly a constitutional goal and therefore, capable of enforcement through",
constitutional remedies under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.,

,FAMILY LAW: MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE
India being a secular country has a wide range of religions that are practiced,
"freely. Each community has its own family law. Hindus, have their separate family",
"laws so have the Muslims. Christians, Parsis, and Jews too have their own sepa-",
rate family laws.,
People solemnize marriages in accordance with religious rituals and ceremo-,
"nies, which are mostly codified by statutory personal laws. Therefore, the matri-",
"monial laws in India, including laws on marriage, divorce and other connected",
"issues, are essentially governed by the personal laws of the parties depending on",
their religion:,
,"Hindu: Hindu Marriage Act, 1955."
＠,Muslim: Muslim marriage is a contract under Muslim law.
＠,"Christian: Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872 and the Divorce Act, 1869."
＠,"Parsi: Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936."
"In India, we have another aspect of family law, which can come into operation",
if parties choose to be governed by it. Any two persons belonging to any commu-,
"nity or nationality may opt to marry under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. This is",
"a civil legislation and parties from all religions, caste or community can elect to",
marry and get divorced according to the provisions of the Act. There is a uniform,
"family law applicable to both persons, though they profess different faiths, once",
they marry under the Act.,
"Under the Constitution of India, all aspects of personal law are in the concur-",
rent list (Entry 5). Both Parliament and the state legislatures have power to legis-,
late in respect of them. Apart from legislation relating to Muslim wakfs and Hindu,
"endowments, state legislatures have not exercised this power to any appreciable",
"extent. The entire codified Hindu law has been enacted by the Union Parliament,",
"though some state legislature have made some modifications; for instance, the",
"Uttar Pradesh enactment, the Hindu Marriage (the Uttar Pradesh Sanshodhan)",
"Adhinyam, 1962 has made, inter alia, cruelty a ground of divorce. This may be",
"deemed to be superseded by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act 1976, which",
"made cruelty a ground of divorce. The Shariat Act, 1937 and the Dissolution of",
"Muslim Marriage Act, 1939; were passed by Central legislature. So were the",
"Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936; the Christian Marriage Act, 1872 and the",
"Indian Divorce Act, 1869 and several Hindu personal law reform enactments",
before independence.,

It is a landmark judgment of the Supreme Court whereby it was stated that,,
section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure applies to all persons irrespective,,
of religion. It was contended that the aforementioned section did not apply to,,
Islam. The Supreme Court negated the condition and made section 125 religion,,
"neutral. It was stated that the husband is bound to maintain his wife, irrespective of",,
what was mentioned in the personal Islamic law.,,

One of the landmark judgments of the modern times. It was held by the Su-,,

"hence was struck off as ‘unconstitutional’. In simple words, the system of pro-",,
nouncing talaq by uttering ‘Talaq’ three times has been removed as a means of,,
divorce. (Talaq e biddat). It is a landmark judgement as the Supreme Court had to,,

"The court added, it was absolutely immaterial whether the failure to maintain",

FAMILY LAW : WOMEN AND RIGHT TO MAINTENANCE,,
a.,What is meant by maintenance?,
The dictionary meaning of the term maintenance is support or sustenance. The,,
term maintenance is not defined in the marriage laws of any of the religious com-,,
munities. But the entitlement of claiming maintenance is certainly based on the,,
assumption that the claimant doesn’t have the sufficient means to support herself.,,
"In simple words, maintenance means the support, mainly financial, which one per-",,
"son, who is bound by law to do so, gives to another for his/ her living when they",,
are unable to sustain financially on their own.,,
Maintenance can be granted to a woman during the divorce proceedings as,,
well as post-divorce. It is paid by the husband either on a monthly basis or in a,,
"lump sum so that the wife can avail the basic amenities of life such as food, cloth-",,
"ing, shelter, etc. The concept of maintenance aims at putting the wife back to the",,
same position of comfort and lifestyle as she was at the time when her marriage,,
existed.,,
There is no fixed amount of maintenance. Depending on the facts and circum-,,
"stances, maintenance can be claimed under the personal laws as well as under the",,
"Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or the Protection of Women from Domestic",,
"Violence Act, 2005.",,
"As defined under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, maintenance in-",,
"cludes provision for food, clothing, residence, education, medical attendance and",,
"treatment. In the case of an unmarried daughter, it includes the reasonable mar-",,
riage expenses also.,,
"Please note that under different provisions, a husband or aged father or son",,
may be entitled to claim maintenance. Here provisions are explained with refer-,,
"ence to wives, mothers and daughters only.",,
HINDU LAW,,
The various provisions dealing with maintenance under Hindu Law are:,,
"a. Provisions under Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.",,
"b. Provisions under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.",,
"c. Provisions under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956.",,
"d. Provisions under the Protection of Women from the Domestic Violence Act,",,

"maintenance, if she:",,,,,
,a.,"has indulged in adulterous relationship or is unchaste, or",,,
,b.,ceases to be a Hindu by conversion to another religion,,,
,"It is also important to note here that in order to be entitled for the relief, the",,,,
"marriage must be a valid marriage. In other words, if the marriage is illegal then the",,,,,
matrimonial relationship between the husband and wife is non-existent and there-,,,,,
"fore no right of maintenance accrues to the wife. However, in particular cases the",,,,,
presumption of marriage is given more weightage and the bars to maintenance are,,,,,
"removed. Further, under if the husband is ready to cohabit with the wife, generally,",,,,,
the claim of the wife is defeated.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏWhat is the nature of relief granted as Maintenance?

,"No, the right of a married woman to reside separately and claim maintenance,",,,,
even if she is not seeking divorce or any other major matrimonial relief has been,,,,,
recognised in Hindu law alone. The Act envisages certain situations in which it may,,,,,
become impossible for a wife to continue to reside and cohabit with the husband,,,,,
but she may not want to break the matrimonial tie for various reasons ranging from,,,,,
"growing children to social stigma. Thus, in order to realise her claim, the Hindu",,,,,
wife must prove that one of the situations (in legal parlance ‘grounds’) as stated in,,,,,

,＠,The term parent here also includes an issueless stepmother.,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏWhat is the Quantum of Maintenance provided under the Act?
,The means and capacity of a person against whom the award has to be made,,,,
should be taken into consideration for determining the quantum of maintenance. In,,,,,
"fact, in case of the husband, it is not only the actual earning, but also his potential",,,,,
"earning capacity, which must be considered i.e., there is a presumption that every",,,,,
able-bodied person has a capacity to earn and maintain his wife. The income of,,,,,

1,Divyananda v. Jayarai [1984 Cri LJ (NOC) 10 Mad]
Two Roman Catholic entered into Suyamaryadhai form of marriage and lived,
together as husband and wife for a period of 5 months in the course of which the,
wife conceived a child. The Court rejected the petition of the woman for compen-,
sation under section 125 of Cr.P.C. as she was not a legally wedded wife.,
"The Court held that being Christian, their marriage in accordance to Hindu",
customs without any conversion was void ab-initio and hence the woman was not,
a wife in the eye of law. As such the woman could not claim maintenance under,
"Section 125 of, although her children, though illegitimate, would be entitled to",
maintenance under Section 125.,
2,Danial Latifi v. Union of India [AIR 2001 SC 3958]
The case challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on,
"Divorce) Act, 1986.",
The court observed that divorced Muslim woman who has not remarried and,
who is not able to maintain herself after Iddat period can proceed as provided,
under section 4 of the Act against her relatives who are liable to maintain her in,
proportion to the properties which they inherit on her death according to Muslim,
Law from such divorced woman including her children and parents. If any of the,
"relatives are unable to pay maintenance, the Magistrate may direct the State Wakf",
Board established under the Act to pay such maintenance. The provisions of the,
"act are not in conflict with the Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India.",
"It was held to be constitutionally valid, and though the maintenance has to be",
"paid within the iddat period, it must be enough to maintain her for her whole life.",
3,D. Krishna PrasadaRao v. K. Jayashri [AIR 1986 AP 126]
"In this case, a father’s obligation to maintain the Children was examined.",
The Section 20 of Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act casts an absolute obli-,
gation on the part of the parent regarding maintenance. The language employed in,
Section 20 imposes a duty on the part of the parent though it purports to preserve,
a right to the child.,
"Hence, in the present case, it was held that the burden is on the parent to",
"establish in an action brought for maintenance, that there is no default on his or her",
"part. Where the father had initially set up family at a Town, even assuming that his",
"wife and children were unwilling to come back, to native village where the father",
"had shifted, omission of the father to take steps to bring the children to the native",
village or send money for their maintenance clearly established the default on the,
part of the father and thus attract the liability under Section 20 towards the children.,

4,Mumtazben Jushabbhai Sipahi v. Mahebubkhan Usmankhan,
Pathan & another [1999 Cri LJ 888 (Guj)],,
The question before the court was: whether a Muslim Women could claim,,
maintenance from her former husband either under provisions of Ss. 125 to 128,,
of Code or under S. 3 of Muslim Women Act (1986) even after “Talaq”.,,
"It was observed that, under Section 4 of the Muslim Women Act, a divorced",,
woman is entitled to get maintenance from her relatives such as her children or par-,,
ents or from Wakf Board if she is not able to maintain herself after the iddat period,,
from the provision and maintenance made and paid by her former husband.,,
It was held that there is no provision in the Muslim Women Act which nullifies,,
the orders passed by the Magistrate under Section 125 or 127 of the Cr.P.C.,,
ordering the husband to pay maintenance to the divorced woman or take away,,
the rights vested which are crystallized by the orders passed under Section 125 or,,
127 of the Cr.P.C.,,
5,Dayali Sukhlal Sahu v. Smt. Anju Bai SantoshSahu [AIR 2010 Chh,
80],,
"In this case, the court dealt with the issue regarding the obligation of the father-",,
in-law to maintain the daughter-in-law.,,
"The Court observed that, under Section 19 of Hindu Adoption & Maintenance",,
"Act, one of the conditions for the father-in-law to maintain the daughter-in-law is",,
that the daughter-in-law should be unable to maintain herself from the estate of her,,
parents.,,
It was further discussed that clear finding is necessary as to whether her parents,,
"have sufficient estate to maintain her and in what circumstances, she is unable to",,
"maintain herself or by her parents. For this purpose, parents of daughter-in-laws",,
are required to be heard. This is possible if they are made parties to the suit. In,,
their absence any finding will not bind them.,,
In the cases where the daughter-in-law can maintain herself through the estate,,
"of her parents, the question of obligation of the father-in-law does not arise. It is",,
also to be found whether there is any coparcenary property in the hands of the,,
father-in-law from which the daughter in-law is being deprived of her share.,,
6,Mohd. Ahmed khan v. Shah bano Begum & other [AIR 1985 SC,
945],,
"The appellant, a Muslim, was married in 1932 and in 1975 was driven out of",,
"the matrimonial home. The respondent filed a petition under Section 125, Cr.P.C.",,
in April 1978 against the appellant claiming maintenance at the rate of Rs. 500 per,,
month.,,

Dismissing the husband’s appeal with costs and adding that it would be open to,
the respondent to make an application under Section 127(1) of the code for in-,
creasing the allowance of maintenance granted to her on proof of a change in the,
circumstances as envisaged by that Section.,
The Supreme Court held that Section 125 was applicable to all irrespective of,
their religion. Clause (b) of Section 125(1) contains no words of limitation so as to,
justify exclusion of Muslim women.,

FAMILY LAW : JUDICIAL SEPARATION,
INTRODUCTION,
"In our Society, marriage is considered as a sacrament. It is an irrevocable rela-",
tionship between husband and wife established through rituals and customs.,
A marriage ceremony is considered to be one of the most essential and auspi-,
cious arrangements between a man and a woman. The religious duties of mar-,
"riage, according to Hindu religion is that of a permanent connection between the",
"husband and the wife which is unbreakable and endless in nature, valid not only",
for the present lifetime but for the next lifetimes to come in the future. This cer-,
emony is thus performed with utmost religious practices and rituals.,
"With time, if the spouses start having a bitter relationship, the marriage starts to",
fail. To save the failed marriage from the divorce there is a provision for judicial,
separation under the Hindu law where the parties have the chance to reconcile.,
"Judicial Separation means, to give some time to both husband and wife for self-",
analysis of a disturbed married life. Law gives a chance to both the husband and,
wife to rethink about the failures in their relationship while at the same time guiding,
"them to live separately. By doing this, the law allows them the independence to",
think about their future path and it is the last option available to both the spouses,
for the legal breakup of the marriage.,

1,Manisha Tyagi v. Capt. Deepak Kumar [AIR 2010 SC 1042],
Marriage between the parties was solemnized as per the Hindu rites at New,,
"Delhi on 17.11.1991. For a short period after the marriage, the couple stayed at",,
Meerut where the husband was posted as a Captain in the Indian Army. Mutual,,
cohabitation of the parties seems to have come to an end on 30.12.1992. They,,
had been living separately since 31.12.1992. They had a daughter who was born,,
"on 2.6.1993.On 24.11.1993, the husband filed a petition under Section 13 of the",,
Hindu Marriage Act for dissolution of the marriage. The husband mentioned nu-,,
"merous instances for the divorce petition. He described the wife as quarrelsome,",,
rude and ill-mannered. He had gone to the extent of terming his wife to be schizo-,,
"phrenic, making his life a living hell. The husband then complained that the wife has",,
been making baseless complaints to his superiors. This has affected his career,,
prospects in the Army.,,
The appellate court came to the conclusion that both the parties had made,,
"extremely serious allegations, and adopted a middle path by granting a decree of",,
"judicial separation under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, so that the parties",,
"might ponder over their differences and re-unite, for the welfare of their daughter.",,
The subsequent appeal before the Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana,,
"High Court resulted in decree of divorce granted to the husband; however, the",,
Supreme Court set aside the Division Bench’s order by restoring the single Judge,,
order of granting judicial separation.,,
2,Narayan Ganesh Dastane v. Sucheta Narayan Dastane [AIR 1975,
SC 1534],,
The appellant asked for annulment of his marriage by a decree of nullity under,,
"Section 12(1)(c) of The Hindu Marriage Act, 25 of 1955, on the ground that his",,
"consent to the marriage was obtained by fraud. Alternatively, he asked for divorce",,
under Section 13(1)(ii) on the ground that the respondent was incurably of un-,,
sound mind for a continuous period of not less than three years immediately pre-,,
"ceding the presentation of the petition. Alternatively, the appellant asked for judi-",,
cial separation under Section 10(1)(b) on the ground that the respondent had,,
treated him with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in his mind,,
that it would be harmful or injurious for him to live with her.,,
"The Court granted to the appellant special leave to appeal, limited to the ques-",,
tion of judicial separation on the ground of cruelty. Stating that “We are not con-,,
cerned with the question whether the appellant’s consent to the marriage was,,
obtained by fraud or whether the respondent had been of unsound mind for the,,
requisite period preceding the presentation of the petition”.,,

3,K.A. Lyngdoh v. U.J. Pakem [AIR 1987 Gau 69]
"The petitioner, Kilbert Latam, deposed that she married the respondent in 1967",
thereafter they cohabited and lived together as husband and wife for about 12,
"years and had 7 children. Since 1979, the respondent deserted her and the chil-",
"dren and, very often, threatened to hurt and burn her house whenever she met",
"him, her life was made miserable and unsafe wherefore she had to leave her village",
"and come to stay at Jowai town. where also whenever the respondent came, he",
"used to threaten her; and for such bad and evil behaviour, she had to file the",
petition for divorce as she felt that it was no longer safe to live with him.,
The Court held that driving a wife away from the matrimonial home and forcing,
her to live separately is a clear case of cruelty.,
4,K.A. Philip v. Susan Jacob and others [AIR 2001 Ker 195]
The petitioner married the first respondent on 23.2.1976 in accordance with,
the religious rites and ceremonies prevailing in the Christian community. After the,
"marriage, they lived together as man and wife at the residence of the petitioner at",
Adoor till July 1977 when the first respondent left the matrimonial home and started,
residing at her house at Thiruvananthapuram. The carnal copulation between the,
petitioner and the first respondent was only for a period of one month and there-,
after the petitioner became totally incapable of performing sexual intercourse with,
the first respondent.,
It was subsequently revealed that the 2nd respondent (brother-in-law) was,
having illicit connection with the first respondent and the first respondent was his,
concubine long prior to their marriage. The marriage was arranged by the second,
respondent only to perpetuate the illegal connection with the first respondent. Af-,
"ter the marriage, the first respondent used to go to Thiruvananthapuram once in a",
fortnight against the will of the petitioner to facilitate and indulge in sexual inter-,
course with the 2nd respondent at Thiruvananthapuram.,
"Therefore, the petitioner sought for a decree of divorce or in the alternative for",
a decree of judicial separation.,
"However, the petitioner has not succeeded in proving that the first respondent",
"is living in adultery and there is absolutely no evidence to prove the cruelty also,",
"thus, the court did not grant a decree of divorce but only judicial separation.",

"XXVI of 1952, the grounds for the dissolution allegedly being that pertaining to",
"cruelty. The complainant was treated cruelly, and was not treated equitably in",
"accordance with the injunctions of the Koran, and that the defendant had ne-",
glected or had failed to provide for her maintenance for a period of two years,
prior to the suit.,
The parties were Mohammedan and were married some time in about 1946-,
"47 and they lived together for about two or three years, after which the plaintiff",
went to live with her parents. The husband’s defence was that he had made at-,
"tempts to bring back the plaintiff to his house and that the plaintiff had, without any",
"justifiable reason, refused to come and live with him, that he had not neglected nor",
had failed to provide for her maintenance for a period of two years nor he treated,
her cruelly. The husband further extended that there was no truth in the allegation,
levelled by the wife and that he did treat her equitably in accordance with the,
injunctions of the Koran.,
The Court held that there were sincere attempts by the husband to induce the,
plaintiff to return to him and to discharge her marital obligations but she has con-,
"sistently spurned his attempts and has refused to return, She had no justifiable",
cause to refuse to live with the defendant and if in these circumstances the defen-,
"dant did not send her money for maintenance, it could not be said that he had",
neglected or failed to provide for her maintenance within the meaning of Section 2,
(ii) of the Act.,

,WOMEN AND PROPERTY RIGHTS,
Introduction,,
The property rights of the Indian woman get determined depending on which,,
"religion and religious school she follows, if she is married or unmarried, which part",,
"of the country she comes from. Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains are governed",,
"by one code of property rights codified only as recently as the year 1956, while",,
Christians are governed by another code and the Muslims have not codified their,,
"property rights, neither the Shias nor the Sunnis.",,
"Not only that the customary rules of law regarding right to property, discrimi-",,
"nated against women, but laws enacted by modern legislatures too, to a large",,
"extent discriminated against women. Over a period of time, the law is also evolv-",,
ing with changing times and the discrimination is being removed. The Supreme,,
Court of India has ruled that daughters have equal rights to Hindu family property.,,
Property rights of Hindu women also vary depending on the status of the woman,,
"in the family and her marital status: whether the woman is a daughter, married or",,
"unmarried or deserted, wife or widow or mother. It also depends on the kind of",,
property one is looking at: whether the property is hereditary/ ancestral or self-,,
"acquired, land or dwelling house or matrimonial property.",,
In Islamic law a woman’s identityis not extinguished in her husband when she,,
"marries. Thus, she retains control over her goods and properties. She has a right",,
"to the same maintenance he gives to his other wives, if any, and may take action",,
against him in case he discriminates against her.,,
The laws of succession for Christians and Parsis are laid down in the Indian,,
"Succession Act, 1925 (ISA). Sections 31 to 49 deal with Christian Succession",,
and Sections 50 to 56 deals with Succession for Parsis. Prima facie the property,,
"rights of the Parsis are quite gender just. Basically, a Parsi widow and all her",,
"children, both sons and daughters, irrespective of their marital status, get equal",,
"shares in the property of the intestate while each parent, both father and mother,",,
get half of the share of each child.,,
Self-acquired property is devolved through Will and ancestral property de-,,
volves through inheritance.,,
One can inherit property in two ways-,,
,Testamentary or,
＠,Intestate,
Testamentary implies the property is being inherited by virtue of the deceased,,
person’s will. A will is a legal document that sets forth a person’s wish regarding,,
the distribution of his or her assets. A will trumps all succession laws. In other,,
"words, if someone chooses to divide their assets unequally among their Hindu",,
"children, then the will’s wishes will be followed.",,

168,Women and Family Law
When a person dies without leaving a will that means they are intestate. In this,
"situation, their assets would be divided as per the law governing the religion of the",
deceased at the time of his or her death.,
"When the property passes intestate, then it is based on the rules of inheritance",
which provides the classes of heirs who would be given priority over another,
when the property is inherited.,
Important Constitutional Provisions for Women Related to Property,
Rights,
Provisions,Safeguards
Article 14,Right to equality
Article 15,Prohibition of discrimination
Article 21,Right to Life and Personal Liberty
Constitution of India has a substantially elaborate framework to ensure equality,
"amongst its citizens. It not only guarantees equality to all persons, under Article 14",
"as a fundamental right, but also expands on this in the subsequent Articles, to",
make room for affirmative action and positive discrimination.,
Article 15 of the Constitution of India goes on to specifically lay down prohibi-,
"tion of discrimination on any arbitrary ground, including the ground of gender, as",
also the parameters of affirmative action and positive discrimination.,
The Courts in India take a very vast definition of fundamental right to life under,
Article 21 of the Constitution as an umbrella provision. This Article includes right,
to everything which would make life meaningful and which prevent it from making,
"it a mere existence. Hence, right to food, water, health, right to shelter/ housing",
etc. all are covered under Article 21.,
"Since there is no Uniform Civil Code in India, every religion is governed by its",
"own laws. Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs are governed by one set of laws,",
"i.e. the Hindu Succession Act; Christians, Parsis, Jews are governed by another,",
i.e. the Indian Succession Act; Muslims are governed by religious laws of the sect,
"to which they belong. Thus, there is no single body of law relating to property",
rights in India.,

,LANDMARK JUDGMENT
1,Narshimhamurthy v. Sushilabilla [AIR 1996 SC 1826]
"NarasojiRao died intestate leaving behind him the appellant, an only son, and",
"the respondents, three daughters. After action at the latters’ behest for partition,",
the Court granted a preliminary decree for partition in equal shares of the Sched-,
ule-A properties which included ‘the dwelling house of Narasoji Rao’. The appel-,
"lant canvassed its illegality and impartibility of the dwelling house, by operation of",
"Section 23 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.",
The only question argued before the court was: whether the dwelling house is,
"partible, when NarasojiRao left behind his only son and three daughters? That the",
house is a dwelling house is not in dispute.,
The Supreme Court in its judgment held that the female heirs right to claim,
partition of the dwelling house of a Hindu dying intestate under Section 23 of the,
Hindu Succession Act will be deferred or kept in abeyance during the lifetime of,
even a sole surviving male heir of the deceased until he chooses to separate his,
share or ceases to occupy it or lets it out. But the female heir shall be entitled to a,
"right of residence therein. Provided that where such female heir is a daughter, she",
shall be entitled to a right of residence in the dwelling house only if she is unmarried,
or has been deserted by or has separated from her husband or is a widow.,
2,Pratap Singh v. Union of India [AIR 1985 SC 1695]
Amar Singh was the owner of certain agricultural lands.He died leaving behind,
him two widows named JagirKaur and HarKaur and the petitioner as his adopted,
"son. Under an arrangement, each of the two widows had been given one-third",
share in the Lands in Lieu of their right of maintenance. HarKaur surrendered,
her one third share in favour of the petitioner and it was mutated in his favour. The,
petitioner filed a suit against JagirKaur for obtaining a declaration that she had,
"no right, title or interest of any sort in the lands belonging to the deceased. A",
"compromise decree was passed on July 18, 1945 under which JagirKaur could",
retain the one third share in the Lands in question in lieu of her maintenance and,
on her death the petitioner could get possession of the same.,
The Court found that Section 14(1) of Hindu Succession Act was enacted to,
address the problem faced by the Hindu women who were unable to claim abso-,
"lute interest in property inherited from their husbands, but rather, who could only",
enjoy these properties with the restrictions attached to widow’s estates under the,
Hindu law.,

3,Kamawati v. Digbijai Singh [1922 (24) Bom LR 626],
"The suit was instituted by the appellant, as the sister’s daughter of one Kunwar",,
"Randhir Singh Sahib, deceased, to recover from the respondent (who, as his",,
"surviving brother, was in possession of his estate) a one-twelfth share of that",,
estate. To this one-twelfth share the appellant would be entitled to succeed,,
"under the provisions of the Indian Succession Act. This would be so, Kunwar",,
"Randhir Singh having died a Christian, and the Act accordingly regulating the suc-",,
cession to his estate.,,
It was held by the Privy Council that the old law ceases to be applicable with,,
"regard to inheritance i.e., succession as cases preceded the Indian Succession Act",,
and cannot modify or interpret it. The matter before the court was: Was the late,,
"owner of this estate, or was he not, a Hindu ? If he was, the Mitakshara law would",,
apply. If he was a Christian the Indian Succession Act would apply The facts,,
presented prove beyond doubt that Kunwar Randhir Singh in his later portion of life,,
was a Christian and died as a ChristianThe converted Christians will not be gov-,,
"erned by old law i.e. his previous religion but only by Indian Succession Act, 1925.",,
4,Balchand Jairamdas Lalwant v. Nazneen Khalid Qureshi [2018,
SCC Online Bom 307],,
The Bombay High Court whilst discussing the issue on whether a Hindu who,,
had converted to Islam was disqualified to receive property of the father who dies,,
"intestate had held that when deciding the inheritance, the religion of the person at",,
"the time of birth has to be taken into account and therefore, a Hindu convert is",,
entitled to her father’s property on the father dying intestate.,,
The High Court discussed the provisions of Sections 2 and 26 of the Succession,,
Act and stated that the two provisions have to be read together and not in isolation.,,
"On a reading of the two provisions, the Court was of the view that a convert himself",,
or herself is not excluded from the application of the Succession Act.,,

,FAMILY LAW : THE PROTECTION OF WOMEN FROM,,,,
,"DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACT, 2005",,,,
,INTRODUCTION,,,,
,"For every human being, home fulfills the basic need of safety – shelter. For",,,,
"women, this very house can be a threat to their safety, dignified living, in fact,",,,,,
"sometimes, a threat to their very existence. The threat is so grave that the legisla-",,,,,
ture has been compelled to enact a special legislation for their protection the Pro-,,,,,
"tection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDV Act).",,,,,
,"Even before enactment of the PWDV Act, remedies were available under the",,,,
penal laws of the country to deal with domestic violence. But the same were not,,,,,
efficacious. The preamble to the Act states that it is “An Act to provide for more,,,,,
effective protection of the rights of women guaranteed under the Constitution who,,,,,
are victims of violence of any kind occurring within the family and formatters con-,,,,,
nected therewith or incidental thereto.”,,,,,
,This legislation was brought into force as an attempt to translate into reality the,,,,
Constitutional guarantee of gender equality and right to live with dignity. The Act,,,,,
seeks to achieve this objective by-,,,,,
, Defining “domestic violence” and connected terms,,,,
,＠Providing machinery to file reports and complaints regarding domestic vio-,,,,
,lence,,,,
,＠Conferring powers on the Court to pass orders for protection of the victims,,,,
,of domestic violence and also for adequately compensating them,,,,
,＠The Act is a piece of civil legislation,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏWhat is the meaning assigned to the term “domestic violence” in
"the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005?",,,,,
,"The term is defined in Section 3 of the Act. According to this definition, “do-",,,,
"mestic violence” can be in the nature of physical, sexual, verbal and emotional or",,,,,
"economic abuse. It can be an act, omission or commission.",,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏWhat are the types of ‘Domestic Violence’?
,a. Physical abuse,,,,
,b. Economic abuse,,,,
,c. Sexual abuse,,,,
,d. Verbal and emotional abuse,,,,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,,,,,
190,Women and Family Law,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,OWhat does ‘physical abuse’ consist of?
,"“Physical abuse” consists of any act or conducts which causes bodily pain,",,,,
"harm or danger to life, limb, or health or impair the health or development of the",,,,,
aggrieved person. Use of criminal force or assault etc. also amounts to physical,,,,,
"abuse. For e .g. severe beating, causing injury with a weapon.",,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏWhat is ‘sexual abuse’?
,"“Sexual abuse” refers to conduct of a sexual nature that abuses, humiliates,",,,,
degrades or otherwise violates the dignity of woman. It comprises of forced sexual,,,,,
"intercourse, compelling to watch pornographic material etc.",,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏDefine ‘verbal and emotional abuse’?
,It includes-,,,,
,a.,"Insults, ridicule, humiliation, name calling and insults or ridicule especially",,,
with regard to not having a child or a male child; and,,,,,
,b.,Repeated threats to cause physical pain to any person in whom the ag-,,,
grieved person is interested;,,,,,
,"For e.g., repeatedly humiliating wife in the presence of outsiders",,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏWhat does ‘economic abuse’ comprise of?
,It includes-,,,,
,a.,Depriving the woman of all sorts of financial resources to which she is,,,
"legally entitled or which she requires out of necessity for running the household,",,,,,
taking care of the children etc.,,,,,
,b.,Alienation of the movable or immovable assets in which she has interest,,,
,c.,Prohibiting the aggrieved woman or putting restriction on her to continue,,,
the use of resources or facilities.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏGive an example of an act of ‘economic abuse’ towards a woman?
,"Courts have interpreted that not giving food to the aggrieved person, interfering",,,,
"with the aggrieved person’s ability to get an employment, forcing a woman to",,,,,
leave her job etc. as a form of economic abuse.,,,,,
,"For example- A marriage hall, earlier managed by deceased husband of a widow,",,,,
is taken away from her by her in-laws and she is deprived of the only source of,,,,,
earning available to her after death of her husband. It amounts to ‘economic abuse’,,,,,
and is an act of domestic violence. [Smt. Sapna Wd/O Nilesh Patel v. Pravin,,,,,
"Ishwarbhai Patel & others, Bombay High Court on 3rd May, 2019]",,,,,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,,,,,
,Women and Family Law,191,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,OWho can be an “aggrieved person” under the Act?
,"‘Aggrieved person’ means any woman who is, or has been, in a domestic rela-",,,,
"tionship with the respondent i.e., the person against whom she is filing complaint",,,,,
under the Act and who alleges to have been subjected to any act of domestic,,,,,
"violence by the respondent. Thus, following are the two essential conditions—",,,,,
,＠,The woman must be in a “domestic relationship” with the respondent,,,
,＠,She must make an allegation that she has been subjected to an act of,,,
domestic violence by the respondent.,,,,,
,A wife can be an “aggrieved person even after judicial separation [Krishna,,,,
"Bhatacharjee v. Sarathi Chaudhuri, 2016 Cri LJ 330 (SC)]",,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏWhat is meant by ‘domestic relationship’?,ｏ,ｏ
,Relationship between two persons is treated as “domestic relationship” if they,,,,
"who live or have, at any point of time, lived together in a shared household, when",,,,,
"they are related by consanguinity, marriage, or through a relationship in the nature",,,,,
"of marriage, adoption or are family members living together as a joint family.",,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏWhat are the essential ingredients of a ‘domestic relationship’?
,The essential ingredients of a “domestic relationship” are-,,,,
,＠Living together in a shared household and,,,,
,"＠Being related by consanguinity, marriage or through a relationship in the na-",,,,
,"ture of marriage, adoption, or being a members of a family living together as",,,,
,a joint family,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ What does the statutory definition of ‘domestic relationship’
include?,,,,,
,The definition of ‘domestic relationship’ in Section 2(f) of the Act includes not,,,,
only the relationship of marriage but also a relationship ‘in the nature of marriage’.,,,,,
"However, all live in relationships will not amount to a ‘relationship in the nature of",,,,,
marriage’.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ What are the essential requirements for establishing ‘domestic
relationship’?,,,,,
,"In D. Velusamy v. D. Patchaimmal, AIR 2011 SC 479: The Supreme Court has",,,,
held that the following requirements (common law marriage requirements) must,,,,,
be fulfilled and the parties must have lived together in a ‘shared household’ for,,,,,
their relationship to qualify as a “domestic relationship”-,,,,,
,＠,The couple must hold themselves out to society as if they are spouses.,,,
,＠,They must be of legal age to marry,,,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,,,,,
192,Women and Family Law,,,,
,"They must be otherwise qualified to enter into a legal marriage, including",,,,
being unmarried,,,,,
,＠,They must have voluntarily cohabited and held themselves out to the world,,,
as being akin to spouses for a significant period of time.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ What are the important factors to determine whether a particular
relationship is a relationship of marriage or not?,,,,,
,"In Indra Sharma v. VKV Sharma, AIR 2006 SC 2522, the Supreme Court has",,,,
specified the following factors to be considered for determining-,,,,,
,＠,Duration and period of relationship,,,
,＠,Shared household,,,
,＠,Pooling of resources and financial arrangements,,,
,＠,"Sexual relationship, children",,,
,＠,Socialization in public,,,
,＠,Intention and conduct of parties,,,
,"Thus, wives, mothers, daughters, daughters-in-law, live-in partners, all are pro-",,,,
tected under the Act.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ Who is called as a “respondent” under this Act?
,The term ‘respondent’ is defined in the Act to mean any adult male person who,,,,
"is, or has been, in a domestic relationship with the aggrieved person and against",,,,,
whom the aggrieved person has sought any relief under this Act.,,,,,
,"However, in Heeral P. Harsora v. Kusum N. Harsora, AIR 2016 SC 4774, the",,,,
Supreme Court has observed that “if ‘respondent’ is to be read as only an adult,,,,,
"male person, it is clear that women who evict or exclude the aggrieved person are",,,,,
"not within its coverage, and if that is so, the object of the Act can very easily be",,,,,
"defeated by an adult male person not standing in the forefront, but putting forward",,,,,
female persons who can therefore evict or exclude the aggrieved person from the,,,,,
shared household. This again is an important indicator that the object of the Act,,,,,
will not be sub-served by reading ‘adult male person’ as ‘respondent’. The Court,,,,,
declared that the words ‘adult male’ in Section 2(q) of the 2005 Act will stand,,,,,
deleted since these words do not square with Article 14 of the Constitution of,,,,,
India.” The effect of this judgment is that relief under the Act can be sought against,,,,,
women and minors also.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ What does a “shared household” mean?
,It means a household where the person aggrieved lives or at any stage has lived,,,,
in a domestic relationship either singly or along with the respondent. It includes,,,,,
tenanted household or a house which belongs to joint family of which the respon-,,,,,
dent is a member.,,,,,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,,,,,
,Women and Family Law,193,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,O Discuss the procedure for filing complaint or giving information
regarding domestic violence?,,,,,
,＠,The aggrieved person herself or any person who has reason to believe,,,
that an act of domestic violence has been committed or is likely to be committed,,,,,
can give information about the same to a protection officer or service provider or,,,,,
the police;,Or,,,,
,＠,An aggrieved person or a Protection Officer or any other person on be-,,,
half of the aggrieved person may present an application to the Magistrate seeking,,,,,
one or more reliefs under the Act;,,,,,
,＠,The Magistrate fixes the first date of hearing. Ordinarily this date is not,,,
beyond three days from the date of receipt of the application by the Court,,,,,
,＠,The Magistrate must make an effort to dispose of every such application,,,
within a period of sixty days from the date of its first hearing;,,,,,
,＠,The Magistrate may direct the respondent or the aggrieved person to,,,
undergo counseling either jointly or singly;,,,,,
,＠,Any relief available under this Act may also be sought in any legal pro-,,,
"ceeding, before a Civil Court, Family Court or a Criminal Court, affecting the",,,,,
aggrieved person and the respondent whether such proceeding was initiated be-,,,,,
fore or after the commencement of this Act.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏDiscuss the rights available to aggrieved person under the Act?
,Right to reside in a shared household: An attempt is always made to make a,,,,
woman submit to acts of violence by threatening her to be disposed or evicted,,,,,
from the house. The Act protects her by empowering the Court to pass an order,,,,,
restraining the respondent from dispossessing or in any other manner disturbing,,,,,
the possession of the aggrieved person from the shared household.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ Discuss the remedies available to aggrieved person under the
Act?,,,,,
,＠ The Court may direct the respondent to remove himself from the shared,,,,
household;,,,,,
,＠ The respondent or any of his relatives can be restrained from entering any,,,,
portion of the shared household in which the aggrieved person resides;,,,,,
,＠ The respondent can also be restrained from alienating or disposing off the,,,,
shared household or encumbering the same;,,,,,
,＠ The respondent can be restrained from renouncing his rights in the shared,,,,
household except with the leave of the Magistrate;,,,,,
,"＠In the alternative, the Court can direct the respondent to secure same level of",,,,
alternate accommodation for the aggrieved person as enjoyed by her in the shared,,,,,
"household or to pay rent for the same, if the circumstances so require.",,,,,

1,Satish Chander Ahuja v. Sneha Ahuja [AIROnline 2020 SC 784],
The Supreme Court in this case overruled the earlier judgment in S. R. Batra v.,,
"Taruna Batra, pertaining to the right of residence available to a woman seeking",,
protection from domestic violence and held that the term ‘shared household” found,,
in Section 2(s) of the Domestic Violence Act were required to be interpreted in,,
"accordance with the plain meaning of the statute. Further, being so construed, it",,
"would include any household in which the victim was residing at the relevant time,",,
irrespective of the person in whom title vested.,,
The Apex Court has clearly ruled that a wife is also entitled to claim a right to,,
residence in a shared household belonging to relatives of the husband.,,

2,Lalita Toppo v. State of Jharkhand & Anr. [AIR 2018 SC (Supp)
2583],
The Supreme Court has categorically held that maintenance can be claimed,
"under the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act,",
2005 (Domestic Violence Act) even if the claimant is not a legally wedded wife,
"despite an order of the Jharkhand High Court, which held that Section 125 CrPC",
does not provide for the grant of maintenance to a woman who is not legally,
married to the person to whom such maintenance is claimed.,
The Bench explained that the provisions contained in Section 3(a) of the Do-,
"mestic Violence Act, 2005 which defines the term “domestic violence” also con-",
stitutes “economic abuse” as domestic violence. The Court further opined that,
"under the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act, the victim i.e. estranged wife",
or live-in-partner would be entitled to more relief than what is contemplated under,
Section 125 of the CrPC i.e. to a shared household also.,
3,Sandhya Wankhede v. Manoj Bhimrao Wankhede [AIR 2011 SC
(Criminal) 567],
"In this case,an important issue was dealt with, i.e. the definition of the term",
‘respondent’ as defined under Section 2(q) of the Domestic Violence Act. A ‘re-,
"spondent’ is defined as any adult male person who is, or has been, in a domestic",
relationship with the aggrieved person and against whom the aggrieved person has,
sought any relief under this Act.,
The Supreme Court in the aforementioned case put to rest the issue by holding,
that the proviso to Section 2(q) does not exclude female relatives of the husband,
or male partner from the ambit of a complaint that can be made under the provi-,
"sions of the Domestic Violence Act. Therefore, complaints are not just maintain-",
able against the adult male person but also the female relative of such adult male.,
4,Krishna Bhatacharjee v. Sarathi Choudhury and another [2016 Cri
LJ 330 (SC)],
The Apex Court while elucidating on the duty of Courts while deciding com-,
plaints under the Domestic Violence Act stated that:,
,It is the duty of the Court to scrutinize the facts from all angles whether a
plea advanced by the respondent to nullify the grievance of the aggrieved person,
is really legally sound and correct.,
＠,The principle “justice to the cause is equivalent to the salt of the ocean”
should be kept in mind. The Court of Law is bound to uphold the truth which,
sparkles when justice is done.,

person aggrieved under such a legislation is not faced with a situation of non-,

"adjudication, for the 2005 Act as we have stated is a beneficial as well as asser-",,

and to ensure that they do not become victims of any kind of domestic violence.,,
5,"Vimlaben Ajitbhai Patel v. Vatslaben Ashokbhai Patel and Ors.,",
[AIR 2008 SC 2675],,
"In this case, the Court held that when it comes to maintenance of the wife under",,
"the Domestic Violence Act read with the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act,",,
"1956, it is the personal obligation of the husband to maintain his wife. Property of",,
the mother-in-law can neither be subject matter of attachment nor during the life-,,
time of the husband can his personal liability to maintain his wife be directed to be,,
enforced against such property.,,

“There is an urgent need to tackle the ills of society against women through,
"active participation of all -men, women, society, governments. It is impera-",
tive to make women empowerment a people’s movement.”,
,- Sushma Swaraj
Introduction,
“Dowry” is a common term in Indian households. This practice has become a,
parasite for the Indian society and has eroded the beautiful institution of marriage.,
"It is not a new trend but has been practised as a custom from ages, and is so deep",
rooted in the Indian society that it is still far from eradication. Several laws have,
"been enacted to prohibit the practice of dowry, but the legal clutches are weaker",
than the ambit of the practice of dowry. India reports a high rate of dowry death,
per year and our society needs to be aware of various laws which prohibit the,
practice of dowry.,
"The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961",
"The Dowry Prohibition Act was enacted on May 1, 1961. The act was in-",
tended to prevent the giving or receiving of a dowry. The term dowry under the,
"Act includes property, goods, or money given by either party to the marriage, by",
"the parents of either party, or by anyone else in connection with the marriage. The",
Dowry Prohibition Act applies to persons of all religions in India.,
The original text of the Dowry Prohibition Act was widely criticized for being,
"ineffective in curbing the practice of dowry. Moreover, specific forms of violence",
against women continued to be linked to a failure to meet dowry demands. As a,
"result, need was felt for amendment of the provisions of the Act and therefore in",
"1984, presents given to a bride and groom at the time of a marriage were brought",
into scrutiny. A rule was made according to which a list was to be maintained,
"describing each gift, its value, the identity of the person giving it, and the person’s",
relation to either party to the marriage. The act and all other relevant provisions of,
the Indian Penal Code were further amended to protect female victims of dowry-,
related violence. Another layer of legal protection was provided in 2005 under the,
Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.,
Amendments were also made to the minimum and maximum punishments for,
giving and receiving dowry and a penalty was introduced for demanding dowry or,
advertising offers of money or property in connection with a marriage. The Indian,
Penal Code was also modified in 1983 to establish specific crimes of dowry-,
"related cruelty, dowry death, and abetment of suicide. These enactments punished",
violence against women by their husbands or their relatives when proof of dowry,
"demands or dowry harassment could be shown. Even after all these revisions, the",
practice of dowry and dowry-related violence still occurs in varying degrees within,
several communities and socioeconomic groups of India.,

,1,Narayanamurthy v. State of Karnataka [AIR 2008 SC 2377],,,
,The case was regarding payment and demand of dowry by the husband and the,,,,
"relatives. It was held by the Supreme Court that, in order to be excluded from",,,,,
meaning of “dowry” such customary presents:,,,,,
,a. Should not be expensive having regard to the financial status of the giver of,,,,
those presents; and,,,,,
,b. They should be entered in a list maintained in accordance with the Rules,,,,
"made under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.",,,,,
,2,Surinder Singh v. State of Haryana [AIR 2014 SC 817],,,
,The case was regarding demand and harassment of the wife for not providing,,,,
enough dowry. The Supreme Court held that the definition given in the Dowry,,,,,
"Prohibition Act, 1961 is a comprehensive and wide definition which covers almost",,,,,
"all forms of dowry. It covers all forms of dowry for the period before, at and after",,,,,
the marriage takes place.,,,,,
,3,Vinod Kumar Sethi v. State of Punjab [AIR 1982 P & H 372],,,
,The following was held by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana “It calls for,,,,
"pointed notice that the Dowry Prohibition Act, does not, in any way, bar the tradi-",,,,,
"tional giving of presents at or about the time of the wedding, which may be willing",,,,,
and affectionate gifts by parents and close relations of the bride to her. Such presents,,,,,
"or dowry given by the parents is, therefore, not at all within the definition of the",,,,,
aforesaid statute. A voluntary and affectionate giving of dowry and traditional pre-,,,,,
sents would thus be plainly out of the ambit of the particular definition under the Act,,,,,
and once that is so the rest of the provisions thereof would be equally inapplicable.”,,,,,
,4,Shobha Rani v. Madhukar Reddi [AIR 1988 SC 121],,,

Court observed the following:,,,,,
,"Bearing in mind the proper approach to matrimonial offence, we are satisfied",,,,
that the facts and circumstances brought out by the appellant in this case do justify,,,,,
an inference that there was demand for dowry. The demand is prohibited under,,,,,
"law. That by itself is bad enough. That, in our opinion, amounts to cruelty entitling",,,,,
the wife to get a decree for dissolution of marriage.,,,,,

"It was held by the Supreme Court that the demand, even if made before the",
"marriage, amounts to an offence under Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act,1961.",
"In this case, the court held that under Section 4 of the Act, mere demand of dowry",
"is sufficient to hold an accused under the offence and that any demand of money,",
property or valuable security received from the bride or her parents or other rela-,
tives by the bridegroom or his parents or vice versa would fall within the mischiefs of,
dowry under the Act. Marriage under this Act shall also include proposed marriage,

Answer: The burden of proof shall lie on the husband. He shall have to prove,,
"that he did not take any dowry under Section 3, and also, he did not demand",,
"additional dowry under Section 4. Usually, the burden of proof is on the prosecu-",,

the same and stated that dowry is prohibited. The parents and Sakshi stated that,,
dowry is only applicable when the groom’s or boy’s family demands valuable,,
security. Is the contention of Sakshi and her family correct?,,
"Answer: No, the contention is wrong. Dowry Prohibition Act applies to both",,
"genders. As per Section 2 of the Act, ‘Dowry’ means any property or valuable",,
security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly:,,

1,B. N. Gamadia v. Emperor [(1925) 27 BOM LR 1405],
"Section 27 of the Factories Act, 1948 prohibits employment of women and",,
children near cotton opener. In this case the court held that provisions of Section,,
"20 of the Factories Act, 1948, are not fulfilled if the partition is made in a room a",,
door made between the two portions of the room and that of the door is shut and,,
"opens at a particular time, or if it is not locked then some preventive action being",,
taken to prevent its being opened by a woman or child who desire to get into the,,
press room or prohibited area. The Bombay High Court stated that it is in viola-,,
tion of provisions of the Factories Act. The Act prescribes specific provisions for,,
women safety and the same must be complied with.,,

tory on the basis of sex. The High Court held that women should not be employed,,
for their own safety and welfare even during the night was an ideology of an,,
"erstwhile age that was out of tune with modern requirements for equality, espe-",,
cially between sexes. With regard to an exception provided to the fishing and,,
"canning industry, this was postulated that it would seem a ludicrous assertion those",,
women in these sectors would be completely safe but still not safe in the textile,,
"industry. Consequently, Section 66(1)(b) of the Act was ruled unconstitutional by",,
the High Court and proclaimed that females in the fishing industry should also be,,
given more or less the same protection as some of those provided for.,,
3,Anuj Garg v. Hotel Association of India [AIR 2008 SC 663],
Section 30 of the Punjab Excise Act has been challenged. The Section prohib-,,
"ited the employment of any man under the age of 25 years and any woman, in any",,
part of an establishment in which liquor or any other intoxicating drug was being,,
consumed.,,
The Court prima facie observed that the challenged provision was a pre-consti-,,
"tution law i.e., the Section had come into force before Article 14 and Article 15 (sex",,
equality) was guaranteed as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India.,,
In this case the Supreme Court of India upholds philosophy of the sex equality,,
and promotes for equal opportunities at workplace for women. This case is a step,,
forward in recognizing sex equality and eliminating old cultural norms embodied in,,
different statutes that confirm patriarchal values.,,

Sangeeta is working in a cotton mill since last 10 years. She handles the spin-,
ning machines from the first day of her job. The Manager asked her to lubricate,

working properly. Sangeeta refused fearing for her safety but the owner forced,
her to do so. Sangeeta did as per the instructions of Manager and lost her right-,
hand thumb permanently.,
What is the remedy available with Sangeeta in the given situation?,

"ing. According to Section 22(2) of the Factories Act, 1948, women are not al-",
lowed to lubricate or adjust any part of a prime mover while it is in motion. The,

PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 4,
Sangeeta is aged about 25 years and she works in a flour mill factory situated in,

,"THE MATERNITY BENEFIT ACT, 1961",,,,
,Introduction,,,,
,"The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 is a social justice legislation that protects the",,,,
employment of women at the time of her maternity. It entitles women employees,,,,,
to ‘maternity benefit’ which is fully paid wages during the absence from work in,,,,,
order to take care of their child and shall be construed as true manifestation of,,,,,
women’s right to health.,,,,,
,"The Act is an important part of legislation for every woman employee, whether",,,,
"working in an establishment such as factory, mines, plantation, shops or in estab-",,,,,
lishments of the Central or the State Governments. These benefits are not only,,,,,
advantageous to the woman but are also essential to bring about a reduction in,,,,,
infant mortality rates in the country and also benefits the management by reducing,,,,,
absenteeism of the female workforce. It also allows women to give their undi-,,,,,
vided attention to their jobs.,,,,,
,The first piece of legislation enacted to provide maternity benefit to women was,,,,
in 1929 in the State of Bombay and since then this right to maternity benefit has,,,,,
"been established as a basic right of a working woman. Thereafter, under the Con-",,,,,
"stitution of India 1950, Article 42 has obligated the State to make provision for",,,,,
"securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief. Further,",,,,,
"Article 39(e) &(f) of the Constitution of India provides that the State shall, in",,,,,
"particular, direct its policy towards securing that the health and strength of work-",,,,,
"ers, men and women, and the tender age of children are not abused and that",,,,,
citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their,,,,,
age or strength; and that children are given opportunities and facilities to develop,,,,,
in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity and that childhood,,,,,
and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material aban-,,,,,
donment.,,,,,
,"The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 aims to provide all the facilities to a working",,,,
woman in a dignified manner so that she may overcome the state of motherhood,,,,,
"honorably, peaceably, undeterred by the fear of being victimized for forced ab-",,,,,
sence during the pre or post-natal period.”,,,,,

2,Rasitha C.H. v. State of Kerala &Anr. [WP(C). No. 5507 of 2018]
The Kerala High Court recently reiterated that women-employees are entitled,
"to maternity leave, regardless of whether their employment is contractual or oth-",
"erwise. Allowing a petition filed by 35-year-old Rasitha, who was denied mater-",
nity leave by the Calicut University on the ground that the terms of her contract did,
"not envision the grant of such leave, Justice A Muhamed Mustaq held,",
“The maternity benefit is not merely a statutory benefit or a benefit flowing out,
of an agreement. This court consistently held that it is attached with the dignity of,
a woman…. it was held that a woman employee cannot be denied maternity,
"benefits merely because her status is a contractual employee. Therefore, the Uni-",
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
Women & Labour Laws,267
versity is bound to grant such benefits notwithstanding anything contained in the,
agreement of contract.”,
"In view of these observations, the Court allowed Rasitha’s plea and directed",
"the Calicut University to pay maternity benefits due to the Rasitha, as applicable in",
"the case of other employees of the University, within two months.",
3. Anshu Rani v. State of U.P. [2019 (5) ALJ 286],
"In the instant case, the Petitioner prayed for directing the Respondent District",
Basic Education Officer to grant her maternity leave with honorarium. The Re-,
spondent authority in the case had granted the Petitioner maternity leave for 90,
"days instead of 180 days. Aggrieved by the same, the Petitioner filed the writ",
petition wherein the respondent has averred that maternity leave was rightly granted,
only for a period of 90 days in view of the Government Orders dated 20.11.2017,
and 3.1.2018.,
The Petitioner on the other hand has contended that she is entitled for the ben-,
"efit of the provisions contained in the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 as has been",
"amended by Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 and in view of the amend-",
ment any order contrary to the same is liable to be ignored.,
The High Court of Allahabad allowed the petition while directing the Respon-,
dent authority to grant 180 days of maternity.,
4. Air India v. Nargesh Meerza [AIR 1981 SC 1829],
"One of the landmark case in which, Air India Corporation (AIC) Act and In-",
dian Airlines Corporation (IAC) Act formulated certain regulations between the,
conditions of retirement and termination of service pertaining to air hostesses (AH),
and those of male pursers (MP) forming part of the same cabin crew and per-,
forming similar duties. These conditions were that an AH under AIC retired from,
service in case of ‘first pregnancy’. The Court held it to be “grossly unethical” and,
as smacking of “deep rooted sense of utter selfishness at the cost of all human,
values” as compelling to terminate services if a woman becomes pregnant would,
amount to forbidding her not to have any children. It has been stated that mere,
pregnancy should not be considered to be a disability but a natural outcome of,
marriage and any distinction made on the ground of pregnancy is extremely unrea-,
sonable and manifestly arbitrary.,
"5. B. Shah v. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Coimbatore [AIR 1978",
SC 12],
"In this case, the question was whether in calculation of the maternity benefit for",
a period covered by Section 5 Sundays being a wage-less holiday should be,
excluded? The Apex Court ruled that Sunday must also be included and read in,
light of Article 42 stating that the Constitution was intended to enable the woman,

"child, preserve her efficiency as a worker and maintain the level of her previous",
efficiency and output.,
6. Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Female Workers (muster roll) [AIR,
2000 SC 1274],
The facts that gave rise to present appeal was that the Municipal Corporation,
of Delhi granted maternity leave only to its regular female employees and not to,
the muster-roll women employees of the Corporation. The Muster roll employees,
claimed for maternity benefit under the Act. The Supreme Court while granting the,
"benefits held that “A woman employee, at the time of advanced pregnancy cannot",
be compelled to undertake hard labour as it would be detrimental to her health,
and also to the health of the foetus. It is for this reason that it is provided in the Act,
that she would be entitled to maternity leave for certain periods prior to and after,
delivery. There is nothing contained in the Act which entitles only regular women,
employees to the benefit of maternity leave and not to those who are engaged on,
casual basis or on muster roll on daily-wage basis.”,
7. Manisha Priyadarshini v. Aurobindo College [AIROnline 2020 Del,
649],
The petitioner was working as an ad-hoc Assistant Professor in an affiliated,
college requested the College for grant of maternity leave along with all other,
"eligible benefits under the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961. But the college did not",
"respond to her request. She reiterated her request, seeking permission to proceed",
on maternity leave and was blessed with a daughter prematurely shortly after.,
"When she reported to the college for joining her duties, the college informed her",
that she was terminated from service. The Court directed the College to reinstate,
"the Professor within one week, and also imposed a cost of ` 50,000 for wrongful",
termination. The Court further held that the Act of the college is “violative of the,
basic principle of equality in the eyes of law. It would also tantamount to depriving,
her of the protection assured under Article 21 of the Constitution of India of her,
right to employment and protection of her reproductive rights as a woman.,
Such a consequence is therefore absolutely unacceptable and goes against the very,
grain of the equality principles enshrined in Articles 14 and 16”,
8. Pooja Jignesh Doshi v. State of Maharashtra and another [2015],
The petitioner chose to be a surrogate mother and gave birth to a baby girl. She,
"sought maternity leave to take care of the surrogate child, which was denied on",
the ground that the Leave Rules and the policy governing the Rules do not permit,
maternity leave for a surrogate child. The Court held that even in case of birth by,
surrogacy the parents who have lent the ova and the sperm would be entitled to,

avail leave. The mother being entitled to maternity leave and the father to paternity,
leave.,
9. Rakhi P. V. and others v. State of Kerala & another [2018 Lab IC,
(NOC) 133 (Ker)],
The Court clarified that a woman employee cannot be denied maternity ben-,
efits merely because her status is a contractual employee. And held that a woman,
cannot be compelled to choose between motherhood and employment.,
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO,
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 1,
Seema was initially appointed to the post of Anudeshak / instructor teacher on,
20.08.2015. An application dated 26.9.2018 was submitted by her before the,
"Block Education Officer as well as the District Basic Education Officer, Bijnor to",
"grant her maternity leave from 1.10.2018 to 31.3.2019. But, the District Basic",
"Education Officer, Bijnor granted maternity leave to the petitioner only for 90",
"days, i.e., 1.10.2018 to 29.12.2018 with honorarium. The request was made by",
"Seema to grant her maternity leave for 180 days, according to the Maternity",
"Benefit Act, 1961, but there was no response. What remedy does Seema have?",
Answer: Women who constitute almost half of the segment of our society have,
to be honored and treated with dignity at places where they work to earn their,
"livelihood. Whatever be the nature of their duties, their avocation and the place",
where they work; they must be provided all the facilities to which they are entitled.,
"The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 aims to provide all these facilities to a working",
woman in a dignified manner so that she may overcome the state of motherhood,
"honorably, peaceably, undeterred by the fear of being victimized for forced ab-",
sence during the pre or post-natal period. The Maternity Benefit Amendment Act,
2017 has increased the duration of paid maternity leave available for women em-,
"ployees from the existing 12 weeks to 26 weeks. Thus, Seema is entitled to a paid",
maternity leave of 180 days.,

workers on daily wage. Seema was 7 months pregnant and could not get a leave,

grant of maternity leave and the union concerned supported their cause. But the,
Corporation contended that the benefits contemplated by the Maternity Benefit,

"Act, 1961 could be extended only to work women in an “industry” and not to the",
daily wage women employees of the Municipal Corporation. What can be done,
in such a situation?,
"Answer:A woman employee, at the time of advanced pregnancy cannot be",
compelled to undertake hard labour as it would be detrimental to her health and,
also to the health of the foetus. It is for this reason that it is provided in the Mater-,
"nity Benefit Act, 1961 that she would be entitled to maternity leave for certain",
periods prior to and after delivery. There is nothing contained in the Act which,
entitles only regular women employees to the benefit of maternity leave and not to,
those who are engaged on a casual basis or on a muster roll on a daily-wage,

had put in an application for maternity leave. Her maternity leave was no accepted,
as the employer stated it is an adopt child and only a pregnant woman is entitled to,
maternity leave. What remedy does Seema have?,
Answer: According to Section 5(4) of The Maternity Benefit (Amendment),
"Act, 2017, a woman who legally adopts a child below the age of three months or",
a commissioning mother shall be entitled to maternity benefit for a period of twelve,
weeks from the date the child is handed over to the adopting mother or the com-,

Seema had delivered a baby boy in the month of July 2019 and resumed back,
to work in the month of November 2019. She was not allowed to take the second,
break to feed her baby. What remedy does Seema have?,
"Answer: Under Section 11 of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, Every woman",
"who has delivered a child and returns to duty after such delivery shall, in addition",
"to the interval for rest allowed to her, be allowed in the course of her daily work",
two breaks of the prescribed duration for nursing the child until the child attains,

THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF WOMEN AT WORKPLACE (PRE-,,,,,
,"VENTION, PROHIBITION AND REDRESSAL) ACT, 2013",,,,
,INTRODUCTION,,,,
,Sexual Harassment at the Workplace has remained one of the central concerns,,,,
of the women’s movement in India since the early 80s. Women have commonly,,,,,
been a victim of sexual harassment at workplace. The fundamental right to carry,,,,,
"on any occupation, trade or business or profession depends on the availability of",,,,,
a ‘safe’ working environment. When the work place is unsafe and working envi-,,,,,
"ronment is abusive or hostile, it infringes right to carry on employment. This vio-",,,,,
lates the freedom to work of both the victim and other female employees. These,,,,,
"offences could range from uttering a word or sound, making a gesture or commit-",,,,,
"ting an act, all intended to insult a woman.",,,,,
,The voices against sexual harassment at workplaces have since grown stron-,,,,
ger. Specially after the popularity gained by the recent #Metoo Movements across,,,,,
Globe. The Ministry of Women and Child Development has set up what it calls,,,,,
"the Sexual Harassment electronic–Box (SHe-Box), an online complaint system",,,,,
for registration of complaints related to sexual harassment at workplace. The SHe-,,,,,
"Box was launched on July 24, 2017, and received 107 complaints up to February",,,,,
"2018, in just 7 months. We need to further empower women till each and every",,,,,
such act of sexual harassment at the workplace is brought to light and there is no,,,,,
more fear among women to speak up.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏConstitutional Safeguards Against Sexual Harassment at Workplace,ｏ,O
,Women in India are recognized and granted protection under the Constitution,,,,
"of India. The preamble to the Constitution, inter alia, guarantees social, economic,",,,,,
"and political justice, equality of status, opportunity, and the dignity of the indi-",,,,,
"vidual. Notwithstanding these avenues of protection, for a long time, working",,,,,
Indian women did not practically receive the protections granted under the Con-,,,,,
stitution and national or state legislations.,,,,,
,Sexual harassment at workplace is considered violation of women’s right to,,,,
"equality, life and liberty. As enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution of India,",,,,,
equality of status and opportunity must be secured for all its citizens; equality of,,,,,
every person under the law is guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution of,,,,,
"India. A safe workplace is therefore a woman’s legal right. Indeed, the Constitu-",,,,,
"tional doctrine of equality and personal liberty is contained in Articles 14, 15 and",,,,,
21 of the Constitution of India. Sexual harassment creates an insecure and hostile,,,,,
"work environment, which discourage women’s participation in work, thereby ad-",,,,,
versely affecting their social and economic empowerment and the goal of inclusive,,,,,
growth. With this idea the legislature formulated the Sexual Harassment of Women,,,,,

1,Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan and Ors. [AIR 1997 SC 3011]
(Bhanwari Devi Case),
In 1992 a lower caste social worker for the women’s development programme,
in Rajasthan named Bhanwari Devi who was trying to stop a child marriage in her,
village was allegedly gang-raped by five men of the upper-class community. She,
went to the police station to lodge a complaint against the offenders but no thor-,
ough investigation was launched.,
"The Issue raised was, whether the employer has any responsibility in cases of",
sexual harassment by its employee or to its employees at a workplace?,
The Supreme Court held that the sexual harassment of a woman at a work-,
place would be violative of her fundamental rights of gender equality and right to,
"life and liberty under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Indian Constitution. The",
court concluded that such an Act would be considered as a violation of women’s,

"The allegations which had been made in this case, were A. K. Chopra, P.S.",
"To Chairman, APEC had tried to assault Ms. Suchitra Vishnoi, Clerk-cum-",

evidence discloses that A. K. Chopra even managed to make the slightest,
physical contact with the lady. The entire deposition relates that A. K. Chopra,
tried to touch her.,
"The instant case is, therefore, one in which there is no evidence at all of any",
kind of molestation or assault on the person of Ms. Suchitra Vishnoi.,

"When the petitioner was working in the laboratory, the respondent en-",,
"tered, stopped all the machines and pushed her out of the laboratory and",,
locked it. The petitioner alleged that the respondent used derogatory lan-,,
guage. The committee examined the complaint and concluded that the na-,,
ture of the complaint was not sexual in nature but administrative and mana-,,
gerial. The impugned report was accepted by the Disciplinary Authority and,,
was under challenge.,,
A writ petition was filed before the Delhi High Court by Shanta Kumar chal-,,
lenging the proceedings of the Complaint Committee and the order of the,,
DisciplinaryAuthority exonerating the Respondent of the sexual harassment charges,,
made against him.,,
The petitioner contended that the report of the Complaint Committee lacked,,
application of mind. It was contended that the respondent had touched the,,
petitioner’s arm and any unwelcome physical contact would amount to sexual,,
harassment.,,
The Delhi High Court held that any physical contact or advance would be,,
sexual harassment provided it is made in the context of a sexually oriented behav-,,
"ior. A mere accidental touch, even if unwelcome would not amount to sexual ha-",,

her repeated or express refusal.,,
The ruling by the Delhi High Court in case will require the companies to,,

in accordance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Pre-,,

5,Punita K. Sodhi v. Union of India & Ors. [2010 (172) DLT 409]
"Dr. Punita Sodhi, a highly qualified eye specialist, worked as Assistant Profes-",
sor in Ophthalmology at Lady Harding Medical College (LMC) under the Minis-,
try of Health & Family Welfare (MHFW). Upon qualifying she joined the Council,
for Scientific & Industrial Research at Safdarjung Hospital where she eventually,
came to work under Dr. K.P.S. Malik (HOD).,
That is where her troubles and her case began. Dr. Malik was aware that Dr.,
"Sodhi’s husband was on an outstation job. According to her, on one pretext or",
"another Dr. Malik looked for opportunities to get close to her, which included",
calling her to assist in surgeries when it wasn’t required. In his ongoing attempt to,
"make her life uncomfortable, Dr. Malik adopted several ways to harass Dr. Sodhi.",
"He issued false memos about her work, sought her termination, gave wide circu-",
lation of his views to senior staff members and even accused her of negligence in,
"the case of a patient whom she had in fact cured. In 2007, Dr. Malik clearly",
crossed the line and Dr. Sodhi filed a complaint of sexual harassment to the Medi-,
cal Superintendent.,
"In 2010, the High Court of Delhi endorsed the view that sexual harassment is a",
subjective experience and for that reason held “We therefore prefer to analyze,
harassment from the complainant’s perspective. A complete understanding of the,
complainant’s view requires an analysis of the different perspectives of men and,
women. Conduct that many men consider unobjectionable may offend many,
women. Men tend to view some forms of sexual harassment as harmless social,
interactions to which only overly-sensitive women would object. The characteris-,
tically male view depicts sexual harassment as comparatively harmless amuse-,
"ment. Men, who are rarely victims of sexual assault, may view sexual conduct in a",
vacuum without a full appreciation of the social setting or the underlying threat of,
violence that a woman may perceive.”,

"The Apex Court stated, “the Vishakha Guidelines had to be implemented",,
"in form, substance and spirit in order to help bring gender parity by ensuring",,

"his relationships, both past and present, with women. When she chastises him and",,
"threatens to make his behaviour public, he threatens to destroy her career.",,
Mr. Manish’s physical advances and sexual conversation led to harassment for,,
Seema and Mr. Manish is taking undue advantage of his position and power.,,
,***,
,PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 2,
Seema is a daily wage labourer working at a construction site. Every day at,,
"lunch time, Seema sits under the shade of the tree to feed her 11months old baby.",,
"She finds Manish, a worker, staring at her from the distance. Seema feels uncom-",,
fortable and asks Manish to stay away from her while she’s feeding the baby.,,
"However, Manish persists and always finds a place near her. The group of fellow",,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,,
296,Women & Labour Laws
construction workers now constantly catcall and whistle at Seema every time she,
"walks their way to refill the cement or mortar. When she questions them, they tell",
her they are only joking amongst themselves.,
"Ogling, stalking and gossiping against Seema constitutes a form of workplace",
sexual harassment and can trigger symptoms of depression and anxiety among,
Seema.,
,***
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 3,
Seema is a young and a very intelligent team leader working in an Insurance,
Company. Seema stays back at work late one evening with her colleague Manish,
to complete work for an important presentation. Manish offers to buy Seema,
"dinner and later drop her home since it’s been a long day. After dinner, Manish",
proposes to Seema that he would like her to spend the night with him. Seema,
"refuses politely but firmly and goes home. Next evening, Manish repeats his re-",
"quest and on Seema’s refusal, threatens her that if she doesn’t give-in, he will tell",
everyone that she made a pass at him.,
Manish’s threat to Seema that if she does not agree to his ‘request’ for a sexual,
"favour, he will in return smear her character at the workplace as a person who",
wants to use sexual favours to her advantage constitutes quid pro quo form of,
"sexual harassment. Manish’s behaviour is unwelcome, sexual, and has a negative",
impact on Seema.,
,***
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 4,
"Seema works in a garment factory in Nagpur. Manish is Seema’s supervisor,",
and often tries to touch her on one or the other pretext like he tries to touch her,
hand while she is writing in order to show how it’s written. Seema is very uncom-,
fortable with his behaviour. Her colleagues at the workplace ridicule Seema and,
mock her for the ‘special treatment’ by her supervisor. They often gossip about,
her and Manish being a couple.,
The physical touching by Manish is undesirable and sexual in nature. The gos-,
"sip, which is based on Manish’s behaviour towards Seema at the workplace, is",
creating a hostile work environment for Seema,

Women & Labour Laws,297
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 5,
Seema is employed as a domestic worker where she is expected to take care,
"of all the household activities, other than cooking. Most of the days, the lady of the",
house leaves early. Seema is therefore left alone in the house with a male member,
"of the household, Manish. Seema finds Manish constantly staring at her when he is",
at home and often walks around the house wrapped in nothing but a towel which,
"makes her very uncomfortable. On one occasion, while she was sweeping, Manish",
brushed his arm against her butt. When she protested that she would complain to,
"the lady of the house, he threatened to accuse her of stealing, and that he would",
ensure that she loses her job.,
"His behaviour occurring in a matrix of power, is unwelcome, sexual and has a",
negative impact on Seema.,
***,
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 6,
Manish and Seema are part of a business development team at an organization.,
Seema reports to Manish. Manish constantly tells Seema that they should go out,
"somewhere after work hours, perhaps for a late-night movie or dinner. Seema is",
"uncomfortable but smiles and says she is busy most often. One day, Manish tells",
"Seema that if she turns down his request again, her ratings will go down at the",
monthly review and she will not receive the employee of the month award.,
Manish is using his power and position to get sexual favours which amounts to,
sexual harassment.,
***,
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 7,
Dr. Seema is a Neurosurgeon at the Grace hospital. She has refused an offer,
"made by a Senior colleague, Dr. Manish for a relationship. Dr. Seema has kept",
"quiet about this experience, but thanks to the rumor-mongering by Dr. Manish,",
she has acquired a reputation of being a woman of ‘easy virtue’. Now few other,
doctor-colleagues are subjecting her to repeated advances.,
"Dr. Seema’s refusal to the sexual advances of her colleagues, leads toher being",
"subjected to rumors, gossip, character assassination, unwelcome sexual advances.",
This constitutes Hostile Work Environment form of workplace Sexual Harass-,
ment.,

“I am uncompromising in the matter of woman’s rights. In my opinion she,
should labour under no legal disability not suffered by man. I should treat,
daughters and sons on an equal footing of perfect equality.”,
,- Mahatma Gandhi
"THE EQUAL REMUNERATION ACT, 1976",
INTRODUCTION,
A civilized society is not built on the foundation of discrimination between indi-,
viduals in any form. In light of human rights and human dignity the concept of,
"justice, equality and opportunity shall be applicable irrespective of consideration",
"towards gender of the beneficiary. Inadvertently, this has led to a centuries driven",
battle of gender justice and the prime contributing factor to this struggle is psyche,
and consciousness of society since ancient time. Denial or limitation of equality of,
rights to women as to men is unjust and constitutes an offence against human,
dignity which includes equal protection in employment and professional advance-,
"ment. As law is an instrument of social change, the goal of achieving social, eco-",
"nomic, political equality may seem to be reality for women. With special recogni-",
"tion of obligation under Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 1948,",
several legal rights and protections have been provided for women.,
The Constitution of India emphasizes that a true democracy requires not only,
equality but also justice. The idea of economic justice means that there will be no,
distinction between men and women from the stand point of economic value. It,
means equality of rewards for equal work. Everyone should get his just reward in,
return of his labour. The concept of equal pay for equal work is one of the Direc-,
tive Principles of State Policy enshrined under Article 39 (d) of the Constitution of,
"the India which envisages that the State shall, in particular, direct its policy to-",
wards securing that there is equal pay for equal work for both men and women.,
"The principal implies that where all things are equal, that is, where all relevant",
"considerations are the same, persons holding identical posts/responsibilities shall",
not be treated differently in matter of their pay merely because they belong to,
"different departments. Laws relating to equal pay, hence, deal with eliminating",
"such gender-based discrimination. Hence, relevance of Arts 14, 15and 16 is of",
utmost importance.,
"The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 was enacted to comply with these Direc-",
tive Principles. It not only provides for securing equality of status and opportunity,
"by prohibiting discrimination by the state/employer on grounds of gender, it also",
provides for termination of all sorts of inequalities which result from inequalities of,
wealth and opportunity.,
"When individuals are entitled to the same rights, same privilege and same im-",
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,
,Women & Labour Laws,303
"munities & are entrusted with same nature of responsibilities, the concept of equality",,
is fairly applicable. Equality among similarly situated with reference to reasonable,,
restrictions and valid classification is a key. There is always a tendency to pay low,,
wages to women workers as compared to men for the same kind of work. Physi-,,
"cal capacities of men and women may differ. Social, economic, religious, domes-",,
tic aspects of women’s life may serve as obstacles but legislative approach to-,,
wards woman shall always aim at due implementation of constitutional goals.Equal,,
"Remuneration Act, 1976 is without any doubt a great initiative taken by the Gov-",,
ernment to address this important issue of gender equality.,,
Labour Reforms,,
"The Code on Wages, 2019 amalgamate, simplify and rationalize the relevant",,
"provisions of the following four central labour enactments relating to wages, namely:",,
"(a) The Payment of Wages Act, 1936;",,
"(b) The Minimum Wages Act, 1948;",,
(c),"The Payment of Bonus Act, 1965; and",
"(d) The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976",,
O What is the object of the Act?,,
The object of this Act is to provide for the payment of equal remuneration to,,
"men and women workers and for the prevention of discrimination, on the ground",,
"of sex, against women in the matter of employment and condition of employment",,
"such as remuneration, promotions, transfers as well as trainings; welfare schemes:",,
"bonus, provident fund, gratuity, pension, and annual increment and benefits: weekly",,
"holiday, earned leave, casual leave, maternity leave, medical leave, insurance against",,
accident.,,
ｏ What is “Remuneration” according to the Act?,,
Remuneration means the basic wage or salary and any additional emoluments,,
"whatsoever payable, either in cash or in kind, to a person employed in respect of",,
"employment or work done in such employment, if the terms of the contract of",,
"employment, express or implied, were fulfilled.",,
ｏ When it can be said that “work of similar nature” is done by women,,
& men?,,
"Work of a similar nature means work in respect of which the skill, efforts and",,
"responsibilities required are the same, when performed under similar working",,
"conditions, by a man or a woman and the differences, if any, between the skill,",,
effort and responsibility required of a man and those required of a woman are not,,
of practical importance in relation to the terms and conditions of employment.,,

,LANDMARK JUDGMENTS,
1,Mackinnon Mackenzie and Co. Ltd. v. Audrey D’ Costa [AIR 1987,
,SC 1281],
"Under the given Act, the phrase “Same work or work of a similar nature” is",,
used. It causes plenty of confusion and hence leads to litigation.,,
The Supreme Court clarified the meaning of the phrase. When it has to be,,
"checked whether a particular work is the same or similar to other work, it can be",,
determined on the three conditions:,,
a),The Authority has to take a broad view of the similarity;,
b),The Authority has to check whether the difference in work is of practi-,
,cal importance or not;,
c),The difference between the works must be practical and not theoretical.,
2,State of West Bengal v. Madan Mohan Sen [1994 ALL MR Online,
,262 (SC)],
"The main issue, in this case, was the difference in pay between “Agragamies”",,
and fire fighters. Agragamies are the civil emergency staff. They usually are women.,,
Fire fighters are usually men.,,
The Supreme Court held that even though the academic qualifications and physi-,,
"cal requirements are similar for both the jobs, it cannot be said that they perform",,
"similar duties, functions, and responsibilities as firemen. Therefore, the same scale",,
of pay cannot be granted to both of them. There is a significant difference in the,,
"work they do, and so the pay-scale cannot be similar.",,
3,Smt. Bimla Rani and others v. Appellate Authority Equal Remunera-,
,"tion Act, 1976 [2005 (104) FLR 34]",
"In this case, the issue was regarding difference in pay between the ‘Packing",,
Cleaners’ and ‘Packers.’ The former were usually women and the latter were,,
usually men. The defendant employer said that the educational qualification was,,
different the work and their designation was also different.,,
The Delhi High Court said that the designation and name of the post was abso-,,
lutely irrelevant. The main issue will always be the nature of the job. It was held,,
that the nature of the job is similar between both the Packers and the Packing,,
Cleaners and therefore equal pay must be given to them.,,
4,Air India Cabin Crew Association v. Yeshawinee Merchant and oth-,
,ers [AIR 2004 SC 187],
"In this case, it was held that compulsory retirement of air hostess and the option",,
to go for ground duties up to the age of 58 years is not violative of section 5 of the,,
"Equal Remuneration Act, 1976.",,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt Ltd,,
314,Women & Labour Laws
A service condition giving a special treatment to women is saved by Clause (a),
of section 15 of the Equal Remuneration Act. The term and condition of age of,
retirement settled in course of industrial adjudication by air hostesses through their,
associations is a term and condition of their employment fixed in accordance with,
the adjudicatory machinery provided in Industrial Law. It gives them a special,
treatment as found by them to be favorable to them.,
It was held that there is nothing objectionable for the air hostess to agree for a,
lower retirement age from flight duties with the option for ground duties after the,
age of 50 years up to the age of 58 years.,
5,Air India v. Nagesh Meerza [AIR 1981 SC 1829]
It was held in this case that section 16 clearly authorizes restrictions regarding,
remuneration to be paid by the employer if a declaration under it is made by the,
appropriate government that there shall be a difference in remuneration payable to,
the men and women based on a factor other than sex.,
6,Dharwada Dist. PWD Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka [AIR
,1990 SC 883]
"In this case, it was held that the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 is enacted for",
the purpose of payment of equal remuneration to men and women workers for the,
same work or a work of a similar nature and for the prevention of discrimination,
on grounds of sex.,
7,Mrs. Raghubans v. State of Punjab [AIR 1972 P & H 117]
"In this case, a government order which declared women as ineligible for the",
post of a work in a men’s jail was held not violative of Article 15(1) of the Consti-,
"tution which does not permit discrimination of the ground of sex, for the reason",
"that if a woman was employed as a warden, her position would become worst",
and hazardous while ensuring and maintaining discipline over habitual offenders,
kept in jail. It is submitted that this discrimination seems to be reasonable because,
it involved the physical safety of woman.,
8,Govt. of A.P. v. P.B. Vijay Kumar [AIR 1995 SC 1648]
Hon’ble Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of sex-based reser-,
vation in the public employment.,
9,State of U. P. v. J. P. Chaurasia [AIR 1989 SC 19]
Hon’ble Supreme Court held that different scale of pay in the same cadre of,
person doing similar work can be fixed if there is a difference in the nature of,
identical work. Work done and difference as regards to reliability and responsi-,

"Geeta aged, 25 years, isemployed in a factory along with 3 woman and 10",,
male workers where all of them perform similar nature of work. And the Equal,,
"Remuneration Act, 1976 is applicable. Irrespective of this, Geeta and the other 2",,
women are paid considerably less than the other 10 men. What are the remedies,,
available with Geeta and the other two women?,,
Answer: The first remedy they have is to reach out to the employer and explain,,
to him the quandary. It is always better to handle the situation internally than reaching,,
"out to the courts. If the employer refuses, then following remedies are available",,
with them: -,,
a),File a complaint with the Metropolitan Magistrate/Judicial Magistrate,

turing firm. The employer only maintains the register and accounts digitally. He,,
"does not maintain offline registers. The time, origin, destination, date, etc. are not",,
recorded and cannot be referenced later. What remedies does Aishwarya have?,,
"Answer: According to section 8 of the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, every",,
employer is entitled to maintain such registers and other documents in relation to,,
the workers employed by him as may be prescribed. But the above section can,,
"be read with section 7 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. As per the afore-",,

"employer said that the male teacher is a Master in Education (MEd), and Arundhati",
is only Bachelor in Education and is also more experienced. What remedies does,
Arundhati have?,

"dismisses her, stating that they are paid equally, and he has not broken any law. Is",
the employer correct in his assumption?,
"Answer: No, the employer is wrong in making his assumption. According to",
section 2(g) the remuneration includes monetary as well as any other additional,
"emoluments whatsoever payable, either in cash or in kind. As giving a quarter to",
"live and payment of transport bills comes under the term ‘kind’, the employer is",

"“That country and that nation that does not respect women have never become great,",
nor ever be in future”,
,– Swami Vivekananda
LAW OF CRIMES - CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN,
Introduction,
Crimes against women are not considered from only physical point of view but,
"also sociological aspect. There are records of women raped, beaten, abducted,",
and given humiliating treatment. Women have been subjected to socio-economic,
and culture deprivations for such a long time that there are a general indifference,
and lack of awareness of crimes against them. At least one out of three women has,
"been beaten, forced into sex, or abused during her lifetime, according to a study",
based on 50 surveys from around the world.,
Violence against women is not a new phenomenon. Women have suffered the,
"domestic, public, physical as well as emotional and mental violence against them,",
which affects her status in the society on a larger extent. The statistics of increasing,
"crime against women is terrifying, where women are subjected to violent attacks",
"from her cradle to the grave i.e., feticide, infanticide, medical neglect, child mar-",
"riages, bride burning, sexual abuse of girl child, forced marriages, rapes, prostitu-",
"tion, sexual harassment at home as well as work places etc. In all the above cases",
woman is considered as aggrieved person. The advancement of technology has,
changed the phase of the world. From the invention of computers and mobile,
"phones to laptops, tablets, and smartphones, etc. technology is changing day by",
day. Technology has given us the convenience and life. But there is a dark side to,
"it too, it has not changed the status of woman in the society. With each passing day",
these Crimes against women are on the rise. Women are subject to online cruelty,
"which includes threats, stalking, voyeurism, body shaming, revenge porn; child",
abuse etc. there is an infinite list to the same.,
"On most occasions, the abuser was a member of the woman’s family or some-",
"one known to her. Social indicators such as female infanticide rates, maternal",
mortality rate and overall child sex ratio besides the obvious statistics found in,
crime reports are telling signs of this misfit beneath the image of a new age democ-,
racy. The National Crime Records Bureau publishes an annual report titled “Crime,
in India”. The report for 2020 provides us with the latest status update of crime,
records in tune with the above provisions on women-related violence. A total of,
"3,71,503 cases of crime against women have been reported in 2020. It is also",
time for us to think about the psychological impact the woman has when she goes,
through crimes that are committed against her.,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,
Women and Criminal Law,329
No nation can be called as a truly developed nation until and unless the women,
in that country felt safe and secure. Theses ever growing rate in the crimes being,
committed against women in India is an alarm to the Government to make laws,
more stringent and to punish the wrong does. It is either that we become good,
citizens or it should be that we punish the offender.,
O How are the women protected against various crimes in India?,
A woman can be a victim of any of the crimes mentioned under The Indian,
"Penal Code, 1860, but there are certain crimes that are specifically against the",
woman hence they are categorized as the crimes against women. The IPC lays,
down the provisions to penalize the culprit for such heinous offences against women.,
The various sections under IPC dealing with these crimes are;,
"＠Murder, Dowry death, Abetment of Suicide, etc. (Sections 302, 304-B and",
306),
＠Cruelty by husband or his relatives (Section 498-A),
＠ Rape (Sections 375),
＠Attempt to commit rape (Section 376),
＠Outraging the modesty of women (Section 354),
＠Sexual harassment (Section 354-A),
"＠ Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman (Section",
509),
＠ Acid Attack (Sections 326-A and 326-B),
＠Assault on women with intent to disrobe a woman (Section 354-B),
＠Voyeurism (Section 354-C),
＠Stalking (Section 354-D),

The dowry custom in India refers to the system where bride’s family gives gifts to the,
"bridegroom, his parents, or his relatives as a pre-condition for the marriage. The Dowry",
"Prohibition Act, 1961 defined the term dowry under Section 2, where it states that",
Dowry is a demand for property or a valuable security having a nexus with the mar-,
"riage i.e., it is a consideration from the side of the bride’s parents or relatives to the",
"groom or his parents or relative of the groom, for agreeing to marry the bride.",
Dowry is considered a major contributor towards observed violence against,
"women in India. Some of these offences include physical violence, emotional abuses,",
and even murder of brides and young girls prior to or post marriage. The pre-,
dominant types of dowry crimes relate to cruelty (which includes torture and ha-,
"rassment), domestic violence (including physical, emotional, economic and sexual",
"assault), abetment to suicide and dowry death (including, issues of bride burning",
and other forms of murder).,
"ｏWhat happens, if a woman is killed for non-fulfillment of demand of",
dowry and cruelty is meted upon her while such demands are made?,
"After marriage, some families demand more dowry and when it is not fulfilled-",
"either because of the inability of the bride’s family or the denial of the bride herself,",
the groom and his family abuse and kill the bride. The Indian Penal Code under,
Section 304-B of the IPC penalizes dowry death.,
"304-B of IPC defines ‘Dowry Death’ as, “Where the death of a woman is",
caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal cir-,
cumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before,
her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any,
"relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such",
"death shall be called “dowry death”, and such husband or relative shall be deemed",
to have caused her death”.,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,
Women and Criminal Law,331
Here the term “Dowry” shall have the same meaning as in Section 2 of the,
"Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.",
This Section when read with Section 113-B of the Indian Evidence Act states,
that if a woman dies within seven years of marriage due to burns or any bodily,
"injury, and it is known or there is an assumption that just before her death she was",
mentally or physically harassed by husband or her in-laws or anyone closely re-,
"lated to them for extorting dowry, then such death will be considered as Dowry",
Death.,
OWhat are the necessary ingredients of the offence that helps in un-,
derstanding whether the death is a dowry death or not?,
"In order to establish a charge under Section 304-B of the IPC, the following",
five ingredients of the offence must be established:,
"＠ The death of a woman must be caused by burn or any other bodily injury,",
which would not have caused in a routine course of living,
＠Such death must occur within the period of 7 years of marriage,
＠ The woman should have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her,
husband or any relative of her husband,
＠Such cruelty or harassment should necessarily be in connection with demand,
for dowry,
＠Such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been meted out to the woman,
soon before her death,
For the prosecution to prove that the woman died under unnatural circum-,
"stances and that her husband or in-laws or his relatives were involved in it, the",
above-mentioned ingredients need to be necessarily proved.,
ｏWhat happens if a woman is harassed for dowry and she commits,
suicide?,
Suicide including attempt to commit suicide is not a crime under Indian Penal,
"Code (IPC), however an abetment to commit suicide is a punishable offence un-",
der Section 306 of the IPC.,
"Section 306— Abetment of suicide states that, “if any person commits suicide,",
"whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprison-",
"ment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also",
be liable to fine.”,
Section 306 when read with Section 113-B of The Indian Evidence Act dis-,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,
332,Women and Criminal Law
cusses that when a woman commits suicide within seven years of her marriage and,
"it is seen that she was harassed before her death, then it is presumed that the",
"suicide was abetted by the husband or his close relative, hence an offence against",
husband or relative can be registered.,
OWhat are the essential ingredients that help in understanding whether,
the woman has committed suicide due to dowry harassment or not?,
To establish an offence of abetment to commit suicide due to dowry harass-,
ment following must be proved;,
＠ The woman committed suicide,
＠ Such death must occur within the period of 7 years of marriage,
＠ The woman should have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her,
husband or any relative of her husband,
＠ Such cruelty or harassment should necessarily be in connection with demand,
for dowry,
Section 306 has a wider outreach; it is immaterial under this provision whether,
the harassment took place “soon before the death” or not as is a pre-requisite,
under Section 304-B of the IPC.,
ｏWhat is the meaning of the term ‘cruelty’ meted out by the husband,
or his relatives upon wife during the course of their marriage?,
"Section 498-A of the IPC provides that, “Whoever, being the husband or the",
"relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be",
punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall,
also be liable to fine”.,
"Elaborating further, “cruelty” means—",
＠ Any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to,
"commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health",
(whether mental or physical) of the woman; or,
＠ Harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing,
her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any prop-,
erty or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person,
related to her to meet such demand;,
"＠ The expression “cruelty” is a wide term that includes, inflicting physical or",
mental harm to the body or health of the woman and indulging in acts of,
harassment with a view to coerce her or her relations to meet any unlawful,
demand for any property or valuable security. Harassment for dowry falls,
within the sweep of latter limb of the section.,

OWhat are the circumstances or incidences against a wife that estab-,
lish ‘cruelty’?,
Cruelty is an essence of Section 498-A; it prevents husband or relative of hus-,
band of a woman from subjecting her to cruelty. To bring out an offence under this,
"Section, the prosecution must prove:",
＠ That the victim was a married lady,
＠ That she has been subjected to cruelty by her husband or the relatives of,
husband,
＠ That such cruelty consisted of harassment of women to force her for certain,
demands or,
＠ A willful conduct by husband on his relatives which drove her to commit,
suicide or to injure herself grievously,
＠ Such cruelty may be mental or physical in nature,
Cruelty is a continuing offence. The law through this provision tries to prevent,
"offences being committed within the four walls of a matrimonial home, where out-",
siders have no easy access.,

"ment) Act, 2018;",
＠ Punishment for the rape of a woman to be a minimum ten years’ rigorous,
imprisonment which may extend to imprisonment for life. (Section 376(1)).,

"rape, where the woman is under 12 years of age.",
"In addition to this, a fine may also be levied, which will be just and reasonable to",
"cover the medical expenses and rehabilitation of the victim, and will be paid to her.",
ｏWhat is the meaning of ‘Gang rape’?,
A national outrage due to the gang rape of a medical student in Delhi in 2012,
led to revamping of Criminal Justice System. It led to Insertion of a provision for,
"gang rape vide Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013. As per newly inserted",
"Section 376-D in the IPC, when a woman is raped by more than one person",
"acting in furtherance of a common intention, they commit Gang Rape on her. The",
cohesion or meeting of minds between the accused persons is a necessary re-,

OHow is the offence of ‘Sexual Harassment” defined under the Crimi-,
"nal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013?",
The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 2013 for the first time statutorily de-,
fined the term “Sexual Harassment” under Section 354-A. This provision has its,
origin in the famous judgment of Supreme Court of India where Vishakha Guide-,
lines given by the Supreme Court of India in Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan [AIR,
1997 SC 3011] were issued by it to prevent sexual harassment of women at,
workplace.,
Section 354-A provides that a man shall be guilty of sexual harassment against,
women in following situations,

＠ Demands or request for sexual favours,
＠ Shows pornography against the will of a woman,
＠ Makes sexually remarks on woman,
This is a gender specific offence where only a man can be punished under the,
provision.,
ｏWhat further changes were brought in the laws governing sexual,
"harassment vide the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013?",

"Criminal (Amendment) Act, 2013, led to introduction of the Sexual Harassment",
"of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.",
ｏWhat are the important facets of The Sexual Harassment of Women,
"at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (PoSH",
Act)?,
This Act broadened the definition of the term ‘sexual harassment’ and laid down,
several provisions for its prevention and redress:,
＠ Provide a safe working environment at the workplace,
＠ Form an Internal Compliance Committee and monitor its duties/procedures,
"＠ Organise workshops for raising awareness about rights, safety and security",
of women,
＠ Publicise the penal consequences and penal action for sexual harassment at,
workplace,
"＠ Submit an annual report on the cases filed, and actions taken therein",

Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,
338,Women and Criminal Law
"protection of regular/temporary/ad hoc-daily wage employees, whether for remu-",
neration or not and can also include volunteers if need be. This Act also covers,
domestic workers. Hence this new enactment has tried to comprehensively cover,
working women from all the sectors and strata of the society including ones be-,
longing to organized as well as unorganized sectors.,
OWhat is the meaning of insult to the modesty of a woman?,

"to outrage her modesty an offence under Section 354 is made out. However, acts",
which are done intending to insult the modesty of a woman which may not neces-,
sarily involve any physical advances or actions are brought within a separate pro-,
vision of Section 509 of IPC.,
"It states that, – “Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman, utters",
"any word, makes any sound or gesture, or exhibits any object, intending that such",
"word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen, by such",
"woman, or intrudes upon the privacy of such woman, shall be punished with simple",
"imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, and also with fine”.",
This provision tries to deter any kind of insult to a woman’s modesty whether,
"by any word, gesture or act or by intruding upon the privacy of such woman.",
ｏWhat are the necessary requirements to constitute an offence under,
Section 509 of the IPC?,
Essential requirements under Section 509 of the IPC are-,
＠ An intention to insult the modesty of a woman;,
＠ The insult must be caused either by intruding upon the privacy of a woman; or,
"＠ by making any gesture or sound, uttering any word or exhibiting any object",
OTHER NEWLY ADDED OFFENCES UNDER THE CRIMINAL,
"LAW (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2013",
"The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 was introduced as an aftermath of",
"the heinous ‘Nirbhaya Case’ passed in 2013, This Act provides for amendment of",
"Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973",
on laws related to sexual offences. Following new offences were added via this,
Act,
＠Acid Attack [Sections 326-A & 326-B],
＠Attempt to Acid attack [326-B],
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,
Women and Criminal Law,339
 Disrobing a Woman (Stripping) [Section 354-B],
＠Voyeurism [Section 354-C],
＠Stalking [Section 354-D],
ｏWhat does Acid Attack mean?,
"An acid attack is a form of violence against women, where the perpetrator",
throws acid on a person /victim in order to deface or kill them. As acid melts flesh,
"and even the bones of a person, it causes an unparalleled degree of pain to the",
victim and leaves her mutilated and scarred and can also create permanent dis-,
abilities such as blindness.,
"Despite several instances of acid attacks in India, there were no specific law",
"that dealt with this crime. Prior to the amendments in 2013, such cases were",
registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that dealt with,
"hurt, attempt to murder, murder and grievous hurt by corrosive substances.",
ｏHow has Acid Attack been incorporated vide the Criminal (Amend-,
"ment) Act, 2013?",
"The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 incorporated Sections 326-A and",
326-B with an intention of creating specific provisions for punishment in the case,
of acid attack.,
"Section 326-A states that,“ Whoever causes permanent or partial damage or",
"deformity to, or bums or maims or disfigures or disables, any part or parts of the",
body of a person or causes grievous hurt by throwing acid on or by administering,
"acid to that person, or by using any other means with the intention of causing or",
"with the knowledge that he is likely to cause such injury or hurt, shall be punished",
with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than ten,
"years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and with fine;",
Provided that such fine shall be just and reasonable to meet the medical ex-,
penses of the treatment of the victim;,
Provided further that any fine imposed under this section shall be paid to the,
victim”,
This provision focuses on voluntarily causing grievous hurt by using acid. In,
"view of this section, whosoever causes permanent or partial damage or burns,",
disfigures or disables any part of the body of a person or causes grievous hurt by,
throwing or administering acid with an intention to cause such injury or hurt will be,
punished with imprisonment of at least ten years which may extend to life impris-,
onment with fine.,
Section 326-B has more legislative focus on the act of throwing or attempting,
to throw acid with the intention of causing grievous hurt. The punishment under,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,
340,Women and Criminal Law
this section is imprisonment of not less than five years with fine which may extend,
up to seven years. Fine shall be just and reasonable to meet medical expenses for,
treatment of victim.,
"The offence is no longer gender-neutral, only a man can commit the offence on",
a woman.,
OWhat are the guidelines given by the Supreme Court of India in the,
case of Laxmi v. Union of India [AIR Online 2013 SC 223]?,
"In this case, the Apex Court issued multiple directions including the one for the",
regulation of sale of acid to States and UTs. It prohibited over-the-counter sale of,
acid and prevented the sale of acid to any person below 18 years of age.,
The Court gave powers to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to confiscate unde-,
clared stocks of acid and gave powers to them for suitably fining such sellers.,
"The Apex Court addressed the problem of compensation, where it held that",
Section 357-A of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for the preparation of a,
scheme for providing funds for the purpose of compensation to the victim or his,
dependents who have suffered loss or injury as a result of crime and who require,
rehabilitation. The Supreme Court further directed that acid attacks victims shall,
be paid compensation of at least Rs. 3 Lakh by the concerned State Government/,
UT as aftercare and rehabilitation cost.,
ｏWhat is understood by the term “Disrobing a Woman” (Stripping) as,
per the IPC?,
Section 354-B of the IPC Section penalizes the offence of assaulting or using,
criminal force to a woman or abetting any such act with an intention to disrobe or,
"compel her to be naked, with a punishment of not less than three years which may",
"extend to seven years, with a fine.",
"Section 354-B states that, “Any man who assaults or uses criminal force to any",
woman or abets such act with the intention of disrobing or compelling her to be,
"naked, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which",
"shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years, and shall",
also be liable to fine”.,
"It is a gender specific offence i.e., only a man can be punished under this section",
for an offence committed against a woman. The immediate implication of this pro-,
vision is that use of force with an intention to disrobe a woman or make her naked,
"will no longer amount to outraging the modesty of a woman, but will attract a more",
stringent punishment under this section.,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,
Women and Criminal Law,341
OWhat does Voyeurism mean?,
The word ‘voyeurism’ means appeasement derived from observing the genital,
"or sexual acts of others, usually secretly. This provision is divided in two different",
"parts. Firstly, when a person watches or captures image of a woman engaging in",
"some private act and secondly, when the person disseminates or spread such",
images.,
"As per Section 354-C of the Indian Penal Code 1860, “ Voyeurism is when",
"any man who watches, or captures the image of a woman engaging in a private act",
in circumstances where she would usually have the expectation of not being ob-,
served either by the perpetrator or by any other person at the behest of the perpe-,
trator or disseminates such image shall be punished on first conviction with impris-,
"onment of either description for a term which shall not be less than one year, but",
"which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine, and be punished",
"on a second or subsequent conviction, with imprisonment of either description for",
"a term which shall not be less than three years, but which may extend to seven",
"years, and shall also be liable to fine”.",
"The offence is no longer gender-neutral, only a man can commit the offence on",
a woman.,
ｏWhat is meant by the offence of Stalking?,
"Stalking means the act or instance of following another person stealthily, or",
following or loitering around another person to annoy or harass that other person,
or to do a further crime.,
The definition as mentioned under Section 354-D of the IPC has been broken,
"down into clauses, The exclusion clause and the following sentence has been re-",
moved “or watches or spies on a person in a manner that results in a fear of,
"violence or serious alarm or distress in the mind of such person, or interferes with",
"the mental peace of such person, commits the offence of stalking”. Punishment for",
the offence has been changed; a man committing the offence of stalking would be,
"liable for imprisonment up to three years for the first offence, and shall also be",
liable to fine and for any subsequent conviction would be liable for imprisonment,
up to five years and with fine.,
"The offence is no longer gender-neutral, only a man can commit the offence on",
a woman.,
ｏHow have the Amendments to Criminal Laws proved to be benefi-,
cial?,
＠The Criminal Law (Amendment) Acts of 2013 and 2018 have brought sig-,
nificant changes in the criminal law of the country.,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,
342,Women and Criminal Law,
 These amendments have the objective of making anti-rape laws more severe,,
,so as to decrease the rate of crime. These Acts intends to shield the women,
,from a horrifying offense i.e. sexual assault.,
＠As the wrongdoing rate of committing sexual assault has expanded with legiti-,,
,mately relative merciless of people over the years it became imperative to,
,bring in reforms in the criminal laws and protect women.,
"＠Earlier in most of the rape cases, matter went unreported and the lack of legal",,
,"merit, social reasons has been the reason which created hindrances for the",
,victim to access justice. But after doing relevant changes in these penal laws,
,Government of India has sought to provide welfare for all the women and,
,increased feeling of safety as a step towards women empowerment.,
"＠The time frame of investigation and appeal, if implemented properly, can",,
,"bring down the crime rate. However, these amendments need to be supple-",
,mented with other changes in the criminal justice system for overall effec-,
,tive results.,

"police, the first step is to file an FIR.",,

court directions for the registration of an FIR.,
ｏHow are the rights of women protected under the Criminal Justice,
System of India?,
＠ Registering an FIR is mandatory for the police,
A woman can file an FIR at the nearest police station. No police officer can,
"refuse to register an FIR, if the offence being reported occurred outside their",
police station’s jurisdiction. S/he is bound to register the FIR (this is called a zero,
FIR) and forward it to the concerned police station.,
＠ Right to privacy while recording statement,
"Under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code, a woman who has been",
raped can record her statement before the district magistrate when the case is,
"under trial, and no one else needs to be present. Alternatively, she can record the",
statement with only one police officer and woman constable in a convenient place,
that is not crowded and does not provide any possibility of the statement being,
"overheard by a fourth person. The cops have to, by law, upkeep the woman’s",
right to privacy.,
＠ Time doesn’t matter,
The police cannot refuse to register an FIR even if a considerable period of,
time has elapsed since the incident of rape or molestation took place. If the police,
"tell you that they can’t lodge your FIR since you didn’t report it earlier, do not",
concede.,
＠ Complaint can be filed via e-mail,
"If, for some reason, a woman can’t go to the police station, she can send a",
written complaint through an email or registered post addressed to a senior police,
officer of the level of Deputy Commissioner or Commissioner of Police. The po-,
lice can then come over to the residence of the victim to take her statement.,

 No arrests after sunset,,
"According to a Supreme Court ruling, a woman cannot be arrested after sunset",,
"and before sunrise. Even if there is a woman constable accompanying the officers,",,
the police can’t arrest a woman at night. In case the woman has committed a,,
"serious crime, the police have to get it in writing from the magistrate explaining",,
why the arrest is necessary during the night.,,
＠ A woman can’t be called to the police station,,
Women cannot be called to the police station for interrogation under Section,,
160 of the Criminal Procedure Code. This law provides Indian women the right of,,
not being physically present at the police station for interrogation. “The police can,,
interrogate a woman at her residence in the presence of a woman constable and,,
family members or friends as per the guideline of the Supreme Court,,
＠ Identity of the victim of sexual offences are protected,,
Under no circumstances can the identity of a rape victim be revealed. Neither the,,
police nor media can make known the name of the victim in public. Section 228-A,,
of the Indian Penal Code makes the disclosure of a victim’s identity a punishable,,
offense. Printing or publishing the name or any matter which may make known the,,
identity of a woman against whom an offense has been committed is punishable. This,,
is done to prevent social victimization or ostracism of the victim of a sexual offense.,,
"Even while a judgment is in progress at the high court or a lower court, the name of",,
"the victim is not indicated, she is only described as ‘victim’ in the judgment.",,
＠ Conducive atmosphere for women employees,,
It is the duty of every employer to create a Sexual Harassment Complaints,,
Committee within the organization for redressal of such complaints. According to,,
"a guideline issued by the Supreme Court, and the Prevention of Sexual Harass-",,
"ment at the Workplace Act, 2012 it is mandatory for all firms, public and private,",,
to set up these committees to resolve matters of sexual harassment. It is also,,
necessary that the committee be headed by a woman and comprise 50% women,,
"as members. Also, one of the members should be from a women’s welfare group.",,

"Facts: The devilish manner of gang rape, in which deceased was assaulted, the",
rod inserted in her private parts and the acts of the accused to destroy the evi-,
dence has shocked the conscience of society.,
"Judgment: Accused persons found guilty of offences which are brutal, diabolic",
and barbaric in nature and falls within category of rarest of rare cases hence sen-,
"tence of death penalty, proper.",
This case is famously known as the “Nirbhaya Case”. It led to national level,
outrage and brought to forefront the issues concerning women safety in Indian in,
general and National Capital Territory of Delhi in particular.,
The Nirbhaya case led to institution of Justice JS Verma Committee to bring in,
reforms in the Criminal Justice System of India which in turn led to impending,
"historical amendments to the Criminal Laws. Thus, came into being the landmark",
2013 Criminal Amendment Act which increased the scope and the ambit of the,
"laws relating to Rape, consent, Concept of who should be considered as Juvenile,",

Facts: The prosecutrix was returning home after her sports meet and the hus-,

sent him to pick her. He took her to his house and raped. During the commission,
"of rape, appellant (the wife) entered the room and prosecutrix asked for the help",
"but instead of saving her, the appellant slapped her and closed the door and left",
"the place of the incident. The accused husband was charged under Section 376,",
IPC whereas the appellant wife was charged for commission of offence punish-,
"able under Section 376(2)(g), IPC.",
The appellant wife challenged the legality of the charge framed against her un-,
"der Section 376(2)(g), IPC on the ground that since a woman cannot commit",
rape and so cannot be convicted for commission of ‘gang rape’.,
Judgment: The court held that a woman cannot said to have an intention to,
"commit rape. Therefore, the appellant cannot be prosecuted for alleged commis-",
sion of an offence punishable under Section 376(2)(g).,

"corded. Since, it was late at night, so there were two constables (appellants) present",
at the police station at the time. The appellants asked Mathura to stay at the police,
station and asked her companions to wait outside. One of the appellants took her,
into the washroom and light a torch focusing on her private parts and thereafter,
"dragged her and raped in spite of her protests. Then, the other appellant came and",
"wanted to rape her but couldn’t as he was highly intoxicated. Since, all the lights of",
"the police station was off and nothing was visible, the companions of Mathura called",
"her name and shortly afterwards, Mathura emerged out of the police station and",
alleged that one of the constables had raped her. The crowd became aggressive and,
"so, her FIR was lodged on behalf of her statement. Doctor’s report stated that there",
was no injury on the body of Mathura. Her hymen revealed old ruptures. The appel-,
lants contended that since there was no direct evidence about the nature of the,
"consent of the girl to the alleged act of sexual intercourse, it can be inferred from the",
available circumstances that she did this with her passive submission.,
Judgment: The court held that no marks of injury was found on the body of the,
girl after the incident and this indicates that the intercourse was a peaceful affair,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,

it is not important that there must be some injury on the body of the victim.,

"In this landmark judgment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the statement",
and the testimony of the victim in rape cases is very important and vital to the case.,
"If there is no need to corroborate her evidence, then the courts should place more",
importance to her testimony and not try to find loopholes in her testimony for no,
reason. If the courts and the law try to find unnecessary corroboration to her,
"testimony, the court shall only add to the injury and the insult already caused to the",

Crimes against Women - Protection of Children from,
"Sexual Offences Act, 2012 [POCSO]",
Introduction,
"Childhood should be carefree, playing in the sun; not living a nightmare in the",
darkness of the soul. Sexual abuse of children is one of the biggest crimes against,
humanity at large. It shakes the human consciousness and affects the normal healthy,
growth of a child. It can lead to grave physical and psychological effects on the,
body and mind of a child and,
"India has one of the largest populations of children in the world, according to",
Census data from 2011; India has a population of 472 million children below the,
age of eighteen. Child sexual abuse laws in India have been enacted as part of the,
child protection policies of India. The Protection of Children from Sexual Of-,
"fences Act, 2012 [POCSO] has been enacted to tackle with the increasing sexual",
"abuse against children in form of abuses like rape, pornography, various forms of",
penetration and criminilises acts of immodesty against children too.,
" Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012",
"The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 received the",
"President’s assent on 19th June, 2012 and was notified in the Gazette of India on",
"20th June, 2012. It is an important piece of legislation for proper development of",
a child so that his or her right to privacy and confidentiality will be protected and,
respected by every person by all means and through all stages of judicial process,
involving a child.,
"The Act was amended in 2019, to make provisions for enhancement of punish-",
"ments for various offences so as to deter the perpetrators and ensure safety, secu-",
rity and dignified childhood for a child.,
ｏ Who is a child as defined under the Act?,
The Act defines a child as any person below eighteen years of age.,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,
Women and Criminal Law,365
O What is Child Sexual Abuse?,
According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO) child sexual,
"abuse is, ‘inappropriate sexual behavior with a child’ and ‘involving a child in",
"sexual activity that he or she doesn’t fully comprehend, is unable to give informed",
"consent to, or that violates the laws and social taboos of society. It includes the",
following:,
＠ Fondling a child’s genitals,
＠ Making the child fondle the adult’s genitals,
"＠ Intercourse, incest, rape, sodomy, exhibitionism and sexual exploitation",
＠ Inducement or coercion of a child in unlawful activity.,
＠ The exploitative use of child in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices,
＠ The exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.,
ｏWhat are the objectives of the Act?,
The Act was enacted:,
1. To keep in consonance with the safeguard provided by the Constitution for,
protection of children under Article 15(3).,
2. To adopt the mandate provided by the Convention on the Rights of the,
"Child, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, which has",
prescribed a set of standards to be followed by all States.,
"3. To protect children from offenses of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and",
pornography and provide for the establishment of Special Courts for the trial,
of such offenses and for matters connected therewith.,
4. To protect and respect the Right to Privacy and confidentiality of a child by,
every person by all means and through all stages of a judicial process involv-,
ing the child.,
"5. To ensure the healthy physical, emotional, intellectual, and social develop-",
ment of the child.,
6. To effectively address heinous crimes against children such as sexual exploi-,
tation and sexual abuse.,

366,Women and Criminal Law
OWhat does the United Nation’s Convention on the Rights of the Child,
mandate?,
The State parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child are required to,

ity;,
b. the exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual prac-,
tices;,
c. the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.,
"ｏWhat were the reasons for enactment of the POCSO Act, 2012?",
The most important reason for the enactment of POCSO was the inadequacy,
of Indian Penal Code and absence of any stringent legislation for effectively ad-,
dressing and tackling heinous crimes such as sexual exploitation and sexual abuse,
of children. POCSO was established to protect the children from offences of,
"sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual harassment and child pornogra-",
phy and to facilitate adequate legal machinery by establishing special courts for,
trial of such offences and matters incidental connected with child sexual abuse,
crimes.,
ｏWhat are the salient features of the Act?,
＠The Act is gender neutral and regards the welfare of the child as a matter of,
"paramount importance at every stage so as to ensure the healthy physical,",
"emotional, intellectual and social development of the child.",
"＠ The Act defines a child as any person below eighteen years of age, and",
regards the best interests and well-being of the child as being of paramount,
"importance at every stage, to ensure the healthy physical, emotional, intellec-",
tual and social development of the child.,
"＠ It defines different forms of sexual abuse, including penetrative and non-",
"penetrative assault, as well as sexual harassment and pornography, and deems",
"a sexual assault to be “aggravated” under certain circumstances, such as",
when the abused child is mentally ill or when the abuse is committed by a,
"person in a position of trust, like a family member, police officer, teacher, or",
doctor.,

Women and Criminal Law,367
 People who traffic children for sexual purposes are also punishable under the,
provisions relating to abetment in the Act. The Act prescribes stringent pun-,
"ishment graded as per the gravity of the offence, with a maximum term of",
"rigorous imprisonment for life, and fine.",
＠ It defines “child pornography” as any visual depiction of sexually explicit,
"conduct involving a child which include photograph, video, digital or com-",
"puter generated image indistinguishable from an actual child, and image cre-",
"ated, adapted, or modified, but appear to depict a child;",
ｏWhat is a Sexual Assault?,
"According to Section 7 of the Act, touching the vagina, penis, anus, or breast of",
"the child or making the child touch the vagina, penis, anus, or breast of such per-",
"son or any other person, or doing any other act with sexual intent which involves",
physical contact without penetration is sexual assault.,

LANDMARK JUDGMENTS,
1. Independent Thought v. Union of India [AIR 2017 SC 4904],
"Independent Thought, one of the leading NGOs which deals with the child",
"rights, had filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court of India. It chal-",
lenged the constitutional validity of exception 2 to section 375 (Sexual intercourse,
"or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of",
"age, is not rape) of the Indian Penal Code. The following issues were raised:",
"a. Whether sexual intercourse between a husband and wife, where she is be-",
tween 15 and 18 years of age would amount to rape?,
"b. Whether section 375, exception 2 is violative of fundamental rights of a girl",
child?,
The Supreme Court held that the exception 2 in section 375 is violative of,
"Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India and also the provisions of",
Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act in context of the age of consent.,
2. Imran Shamim Khan v. State of Maharashtra [2019],
"The case was regarding a Class III student, who refused to go to her mother’s",
house as she complained that the accused had sexually assaulted her twice. In this,
"case, the High Court held that even if a minor survivor in a sexual assault case",
"turns hostile, POCSO Act, 2012, being a Special Law, presumes the guilt of the",
accused unless he proves his innocence beyond reasonable doubt.,
3. Ms. Eera Through Dr. Manjula v. State (Government of NCT of Delhi),
[AIR 2017 SC 3457],
In the instant case rape was committed on a woman of 38 years of age but,
"she was suffering from Cerebral Palsy and therefore, though she was biologi-",
"cally 38 years of age, yet her mental age was around 6 to 8 years. It was con-",
tended that the mental age of the victim must be taken into consideration and not,
the physical age. The contention was rejected by the Supreme Court by stating,
"that such interpretation of ‘age’ would create confusion. Therefore, it was held",
"that only biological age can be a factor under the POCSO Act, 2012 and not",
‘mental age’.,

4. Exploitation of Children in the State of Tamil Nadu v. Union of India,
[AIR 2017 SC 2546],
"In this case, the PIL was instituted upon a letter by the NGO. Following guide-",
lines were issued by the Supreme Court:,
a. The definition of ‘child’ under Section 2(14) of the Juvenile Justice Act should,
not be interpreted as an exhaustive definition.,
b. The Union Government and the governments of the States and Union Terri-,
tories must ensure that the process of registration of all child care institutions,
"is completed positively by 31st December, 2017 with the entire data being",
confirmed and validated. The information should be available with all the,
concerned officials.,
c. The governments of the States and Union Territories should draw up plans,
for full and proper utilization of grants (along with expenditure statements),
given by the Union Government.,
d. It is imperative that the Union Government and the governments of the States,
and Union Territories must concentrate on rehabilitation and social re-inte-,
gration of children in need of care and protection.,
e. Social audits must be conducted by the respective authorities.,
5. Alakh Alok Srivastava v. Union of India [2020],
The following guidelines were issued by the Supreme Court in the above case:,
a. The Special Courts must try and dispose of the cases related to POCSO.,
The presiding officers must be sensitized in the matters of child protection,
and psychological response.,
b. Unnecessary adjournments must not be granted by the Special Courts and,
the cases must be disposed of in a time bound manner or within a specific,
time frame under the Act.,
c. The Chief Justices of the High Courts are requested to constitute a Commit-,
tee of three Judges to regulate and monitor the progress of trials under the,
POCSO Act.,
d. The Director General of Police must constitute a Special Task Force which,
shall ensure that the investigation is properly conducted and witnesses are,
produced on the dates fixed before the trial courts.,
e. Adequate steps must be taken by the High Courts to provide a child friendly,
atmosphere in the Special Courts keeping in view the provisions of the,
POCSO Act so that the spirit of the Act is observed.,

26 countries has prohibited abortion altogether. Advancement of the rights of,,
women has been the concern of the world community since the end of the Second,,
World War. In this background the focus of work of the United Nations (UN),,
since its inception has been the advancement of women in general. This can be,,
"gathered from the Preamble and different Articles of the UN Charter for e.g.,Articles",,
1 and 8 stress on the equality of men and women in achieving international co-,,
operation in solving international problems. Article 13 of the UN Charter lays,,
"emphasis upon “promoting international co-operation in the economic, social, cul-",,
"tural, educational and health fields, and assisting in the realization of human rights",,
"and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or",,
religion. For the promotion of status of women in various fields and to eliminate,,
"discrimination against women, two organs were established under the UN system",,
namely:,,
1,The Commission on the Status of Women; and,
2,The Commission on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women,
The Commission on the Status of Women was primarily concerned (1) with,,
"the improvement of the status of women in law, particularly private law and (2)",,
"with the advancement in women’s enjoyment of their right to education, em-",,
ployment and health care. With Health care the important aspect of a woman’s,,
"life i.e., Pregnancy followed by motherhood comes up. She is the one who",,
conceives and nurtures the unborn baby in her womb and after the birth mother-,,
hood follows for lifetime. Earlier she had no say in deciding whether she wants,,
"to be a mother or not. With the advent of feminism, the women have become",,
aware of their rights. Women have now started taking their own decisions relat-,,
ing to their life and body.,,
This women liberation movement has led towards the highly debated Anti and,,
Pro-abortion Rights. The Feminist and the women liberation movement that,,
"sparked in the 1950’s and 60’s in the USA, gained momentum, leading towards",,
the highly debated Anti and Pro-abortion Rights.,,
"In India, prior to 1971, till the passing of Medical Termination of Pregnancy",,
"Act, the law of abortion in India was contained in the provisions of Sections 312",,
to 316 of Indian Penal Code. They were strict and punitive in nature. Abortion,,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,,
398,Women & the Reproductive Health Rights
was made a crime for which the mother as well as the abortionist could be pun-,
ished and the only exception was in order to save the life of the mother. This strict,
law led to many illegal abortions breaching the law.,
It is estimated that 15.6 million abortions take place in India every year. A,
significant proportion of these are expected to be unsafe. Unsafe abortion is the,
third largest cause of maternal mortality leading to death of 10 women each day,
and thousands more facing morbidities.,
"On these bases, in 1969, Medical Termination of Pregnancy bill was intro-",
"duced in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha and passed by Indian Parliament in August,",
"1971. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 (MTP Act) was imple-",
"mented from April, 1972. Implemented rules and regulations were again revised in",
1975 to eliminate time consuming procedures for the approval of the place and to,
make services more readily available.,
"The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971",
The Preamble of the Act states “an Act to provide for the termination of certain,
pregnancies by registered medical practitioners and for matters connected there-,
with or incidental thereto”. The preamble is `clear in stating that termination of,
pregnancy would be permitted in certain cases only.,
"The Act, consisting of only eight Sections, is a landmark in the history of",
"social legislation. The object of the Act, besides the elimination of the high inci-",
"dence of illegal abortions, is perhaps to confer on the woman the right to pri-",
"vacy, and the right to decide about her own body. Another important feature of",
the Act is to encourage a reduction in the rate of population growth by permit-,
ting termination of an unwanted pregnancy of a married woman on the ground,
that a contraceptive device failed. The Act provides for termination of preg-,
"nancy by a registered medical practitioner only. The MTP (Amendment) Bill,",
"2020 amends the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. Thus, there is",
"avoidable wastage of the mother’s health, strength and sometimes life. The pro-",
posed measures which seek to liberalize certain existing provisions relating to,
termination of pregnancy has been conceived:,
＠As a health measure when there is danger to life or risk to physical or mental,
health of the woman;,
＠On humanitarian grounds when pregnancy arises from sex crime like rape or,
intercourse with a lunatic woman;,
"＠Eugenic grounds when there is substantial risk that the child, if born, would",
suffer from deformities and diseases.,

LANDMARK JUDGMENTS,
1. Krupa Prolifers v. State of Kerala [WP(C).No.37463 of 2008],
"The petitioner, a registered educational and charitable Trust, with the help of",
"media, such as television, newspapers, weeklies, magazines etc., states that the",
"Pharmaceutical Company, respondent herein, is promoting abortion among women,",
by advertising that the use of the tablet named “I-pill” within 72 hours of fertiliza-,
tion will prevent pregnancy and also giving assurance that it will be available from,
any Medical Store without the prescription of a medical practitioner. It is vehe-,
"mently argued that the law in this regard, especially, the Medical Termination of",
"Pregnancy Act, 1971 allows/permits only registered medical practitioners to ter-",
"minate the pregnancy of a woman, that too, in unavoidable circumstances, that",
"too, in accordance with the provisions of the Act. It is submitted that the availabil-",
"ity of these types of tablets, without any restriction, would adversely affect the",
"younger generation of the nation and in the long run, it would destroy morality and",
the society will fall into anarchy.,
Court held that the tablet I-pill manufactured by the respondent is only a con-,
traceptive pill and does not cause abortion; the apprehension of the petitioner is,
misconceived. Though the individual morality concept is based on religious faith,
"which may prohibit even contraceptive measures, the court cannot go into it. Since",
the I-pill is only a contraceptive pill meant for preventing fertilization and not meant,
"for causing abortion, the writ petition was dismissed as devoid of merits.",
2. Suchita Srivastava & Anr. v. Chandigarh Administration [AIR 2010,
SC 235],
Suchita Shrivastava had become pregnant as a result of an alleged rape that,
took place while she was an inmate at a government-run welfare institution lo-,
"cated in Chandigarh. After the discovery of her pregnancy, the Chandigarh Ad-",
"ministration, which is the respondent in this case, had approached the High Court",
"seeking approval for the termination of her pregnancy, keeping in mind that in",
addition to being mentally retarded she was also an orphan who did not have any,
parent or guardian to look after her or her prospective child. But the petitioner had,
expressed her willingness to bear a child.,
The Court held that the victim’s pregnancy cannot be terminated without her,
consent and proceeding with the same would not have served her ‘best interests’.,
Proceeding with an abortion at such a late stage (19-20 weeks of gestation pe-,
riod) poses significant risks to the physical health of the victim.,

3. Dr. Mangla Dogra & others v. Anil Kumar Malhotra & others [2012,
AIR CC 1401 (P&H)],
The marriage between Anil Kumar Malhotra and Seema Malhotra was solem-,
"nized on 17.4.1994. Out of the wedlock, a baby boy was born on 14.2.1995.",
"Due to the hostilities and strained relations between the parties, Seema Malhotra",
along with her minor son had been staying with her parents at Chandigarh since,
1999. Seema Malhotra filed an application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. claiming,
"maintenance from the husband, Anil Kumar Malhotra. On 9.11.2002, during the",
"pendency of the application under Section 125 Cr. P. C., with the efforts of the",
"Lok Adalat, Chandigarh, she agreed to accompany the husband. On 2.1.2003,",
Anil Kumar Malhotra came to know that Seema Malhotra had conceived. Seema,
Malhotra did not want to continue with the pregnancy and she wanted to get the,
"fetus aborted, as despite their living together, the differences between them per-",
"sisted. However, she was adamant to get the fetus aborted but the husband re-",
fused. The husband filed a suit for a mandatory injunction restraining the wife from,
getting the fetus aborted. The MTP was done by Dr. Mangla Dogra assisted by,
Dr. Sukhbir Grewal as Anesthetist. The husband filed a civil suit for the recovery,
"of Rs. 30 lacs towards damages on account of mental pain, agony and harassment",
"against the wife, Seema Malhotra, her parents, brother, Dr. Mangla Dogra and",
Dr.Sukhbir Grewal for getting the pregnancy terminated illegally.,
The Punjab and Haryana High Court ruled that consent is required only of the,
"woman undergoing MTP, and the husband cannot force his wife to continue a",
pregnancy.,
"In Murugan Nayakkar v. Union of India & Ors. W.P. (C) No. 749/2017, the",
Apex Court allowed the termination of 32-weeks old pregnancy of a 13-years-,
"old rape victim holding, “Considering the age of the petitioner, the trauma she has",
suffered because of the sexual abuse and the agony she is going through at present,
"and above all the report of the Medical Board constituted by this Court, we think",
it appropriate that termination of pregnancy should be allowed.”,
"However, in Savita Sachin Patil v. Union of India the Court rejected termina-",
tion of a 27-weeks pregnancy. The Medical Board gave a finding that there was,
no physical risk to the mother but the feotus had severe physical anomalies. The,
"Court then did not permit termination on the ground, based on the Medical",
Board Report.,

Seema was 22 years old when she realized she was 26 weeks pregnant. She,
approached the Bombay High Court seeking permission to abort her fetus that,
was diagnosed with congenital heart defect. Can the Court allow her plea?,
Answer: As per Section 3(2)(b)(ii) the termination is allowed only when the,
registered medical practitioner/s are of the opinion that if child were born it would,
suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.,
"The High Court turned down the plea, arguing that if born, the fetus would not",
"suffer from any such serious handicap as mentioned in the MTP Act. As a result,",
Seema’s pregnancy could not be terminated.,

PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 2,
"Seema was 16 years old when she was raped in the year 2011. As a result, she",
became pregnant. She even tried to commit suicide by consuming rat kill poison,
"but was unsuccessful. In the year 2012, she approached the Gujarat High Court",
"for abortion of her 24 weeks fetus, will she succeed?",
"Answer: Yes, she will succeed. Section 3(2)(b)(i) of the MTP Act makes it",
clear that when the two medical practitioners (as it is 24 weeks feotus) are of the,
opinion that continuation of pregnancy will lead to grave injury to the victim’s,
"physical or mental health, her pregnancy be terminated. Accordingly, the High",
"Court granted permission, citing that the continuation of the pregnancy may result",

ing. Will Seema get justice?,
"Answer: The medical board, after having examined her on the directions of the",
"Supreme Court, declared that the woman’s life was in danger. Here Section 3(2B)",
of the amended MTP Act will come to Seema’s rescue where in such termination,
is necessitated by the diagnosis of any of the substantial fetal abnormalities diag-,
nosed by a Medical Board constituted under sub-section (2D) of Section 3 of,
amended MTP Act. The Apex Court then conferred her justice by granting her,
permission to abort the fetus.,

"Seema, a 36 years old woman in her 30th week of pregnancy approached the",
Supreme Court for permission to abort her fetus that was found to be suffering,
from Down Syndrome. How will the Court handle the situation?,
Answer: The Hon’ble Court will take the help of a Medical Board constituted,
under Section 3(2D) of the amended MTP Act. As per Section 3(2B) the length,
of the pregnancy will not be a bar for denial of termination of the pregnancy but,
only in exceptional cases. The opinion as to whether the given situation falls in the,
"exception or not a Medical Board needs to be constituted. Finally, the Court",
decides the matter on the opinion of the Board. In this case after the medical,
"board appointed by the Court advised against an abortion, the Apex Court denied",
"her permission to terminate the pregnancy, citing that the baby could be “born",
"alive” if the pregnancy was allowed to continue, while admitting that it was “very",
sad for a mother to bring up a mentally retarded child”. The fetus was detected,
"with a rare abnormality called the Arnold-Chiari malformation, where the brain",
and spinal cord connect. But the Medical Board did not find it an exceptional case,
involving substantial fetal abnormalities to allow its termination.,

"with a plea to terminate her pregnancy. After the High Court turned down the plea,",
"saying that “it was a compelling responsibility of the state to keep the child alive”,",
will she succeed in the Supreme Court?,
"Answer: Yes, she will succeed in the Apex Court. The Explanation 2 of Sec-",
tion 3 of the Amended MTP Act makes it clear that when the pregnancy is the,
result of rape then the anguish caused by such pregnancy is presumed to consti-,
tute grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman. The Apex Court,
"appointed an AIIMS medical board to examine her. It stated that “a woman,",
"who has already become destitute, being sexually assaulted and suffering from a",
"serious ailment, should not go through further suffering. The quintessential pur-",
pose of life is the dignity of life and all efforts are to be made to sustain it”. The,
Apex Court then granted permission to abort the 26-weeks old fetus relying,
upon the opinion of the board.,

PRE-CONCEPTION AND THE PRE-NATAL DIAGNOSTIC TECH-,
"NIQUE (PROHIBITION OF SEX SELECTION) ACT, 1994 [PCPNDT]",
Introduction,
India has followed ‘patriarchy’ for ages. A son was considered necessary to,
carry on the lineage of the family while a girl child was considered a curse. Natu-,
"rally the couple looks forward to the birth of male child. Unfortunately, in some",
parts of India the family desperately wait for the male child and for that it tries to,
find out the sex of the feotus and if it is a female feotus it is aborted. Although the,
Constitution of India in its Part III on Fundamental Rights prohibits discrimination,
"on the basis of sex, gender-based discrimination is widely prevalent phenomenon",
in Indian society. Historically discrimination on the basis of sex occurred in various,
forms whereby women have been subjugated in every Strata of societal existence.,
A new addition to it is the misuse of technology for determination and formula for,
sex selection. What is more serious here is the new form of discrimination by total,
elimination of female feotus and not to allow her to take birth. This has resulted in,
the imbalance in the child sex ratio.,
"According to the 2011 census, in the age group 0-6 years, the gender ratio is",
914 girls to 1000 boys which is the lowest gender ratio recorded since India’s,
independence. A girl child is thought of as a liability which the people still want to,
dispose of completely so that the burden can be eliminated at its very inception.,
"“May you be the mother of a hundred sons!”, we all must be familiar with this",
"saying and if we analyze the phrase, we will understand the root cause of the",
popularity of sex determination tests in India. The strong son-preference that has,
"the sanction of religion, tradition, and culture, though declining but still is far from",
"complete eradication. In 1988, the State of Maharashtra became the first in the",
country to ban pre-natal sex determination through the enactment of the,
‘Maharashtra Regulation of Prenatal Diagnostics Techniques Act’. At the national,
"level, the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse)",
"Act (PC & PNDT Act) was enacted on September 20, 1994. The main objective",
of enactment is to ban the use of sex selection techniques before or after concep-,
tion and prevent the misuse of a prenatal diagnostic technique for sex-selective,
abortion. It is an important tool for addressing sex selective eliminations and safe-,
guard the girl child.,

,FAQ’s – REALITY CHECK
1,I am pregnant and my in-laws are pressurizing me to know the sex
of the child because they want a grandson. Can I determine the sex of the,
child in my womb?,
"No, determining the sex of a feotusis a punishable offence under the Pre-Natal",
Diagnostic Technique Act.,
2,"I am pregnant and already have 2 sons, now I want a daughter to"
complete my family. Can I get to know the sex of the child as the Prenatal,
Act only protects female foeticide?,

banned under the PCPNDT Act.,

should I do?,
You can file a written complaint to the Central Supervisory Board (CSB) against,
the staff as well as your in-laws. Sex determination is a criminal offence which is,

1,Centre for Enquiry into Health & Allied Themes and other v. Union,
of India [AIR 2003 SC 3309],,
"In this case, a Public Interest Litigation was filed under Article 32 of the Consti-",,
tution by Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes (CEHAT) for proper,,
implementation of the Act.,,
The Court accepting the contentions of the petitioners provided various direc-,,
"tions to the Central Government, the State Governments and UT Administrations,",,
the Central Supervisory Board (CSB) as well as Appropriate Authorities. Some,,
of those directions were:,,
The Central Government is directed to create public awareness against the,,
practice of prenatal determination of sex and female foeticide through ap-,,
propriate releases/programmes in the electronic media. This shall also be,,
done by the Central Supervisory Board (“CSB” for short) as provided un-,,
der Section 16(iii) of the PNDT Act.,,
＠CSB to review and monitor the implementation of the Act [Section 16(ii)].,,
＠ CSB to issue directions to all State/UT Appropriate Authorities to furnish,,
quarterly returns to CSB giving a report on the implementation and working,,
of the Act.,,
＠All State Governments/UT Administrations are directed to appoint by notifi-,,
"cation, fully empowered Appropriate Authorities at district and sub-district",,
levels and also Advisory Committees to aid and advise the appropriate au-,,
thorities in discharge of their functions [re Section 17(5)].,,
＠All State/UT appropriate authorities were directed to furnish quarterly re-,,
turns to CSB giving a report on the implementation and working of the Act.,,
These returns should inter alia contain specific information about survey of,,
bodies specified in Section 3 of the Act; registration of bodies specified in,,
Section 3 of the Act including bodies using ultrasound machines; etc.,,
2,Hemanta Rath v. Union of India [AIR 2008 Ori 71],
"In Spite of the detailed directions by the Court in CEHAT case, various States did",,
not take any step for effective implementation of the Act and once again a PIL was,,
filed by an activist for proper implementation of the Act in the Orissa High Court.,,
The contention raised in the petition was that there was total inaction both on,,
part of the Central and State Government in implementing the provisions of the,,
Act. The appointment of Appropriate Authorities as contemplated under section,,
17 (1) of the Act had not been made and the State Advisory Committee as per,,
Section 17 (5) of the Act had not been constituted and without constitution of such,,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,,
432,Women & the Reproductive Health Rights
"Appropriate Authority and Advisory Committee, provisions of Section 28 be-",
"came nugatory as under Section 28, a court can take cognizance of the offence",
only on a complaint made by the Appropriate Authority.,
The Centre in its reply blamed the State of Orissa for its negligence in imple-,
mentation. The State of Orissa enlisted various measures taken by it for aware-,
ness generation and sensitization about provisions of the Act. After referring to the,
"Object of the Act and Constitutional principles, the High Court stressed, on both",
"the statutory and Constitutional obligation of the State, to implement the provi-",
sions of the Act.,
The High Court gave explicit directions to the State Government to appoint,
Appropriate Authority and Advisory Committee within 6 weeks and further di-,
rected the Committee to take strict measures to implement the provisions of the,
Act.,
3,Court on its own v. State of Punjab [AIR 2008 (NOC) 922 (P&H)]
"The High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh, took suo motu cogni-",
zance of a newspaper report about Sex Determination kits entering in the State.,
According to the High Court these kits were a huge blow to the efforts by the,
State to improve sex ratio. Being alarmed by the declining child sex ratio in the,
State and to curb the social menace of pre-natal sex selection and sex determina-,
"tion, the High Court on its own motion, issued notices to Central and State Gov-",
ernment. And perusal of the affidavits filled by the Governments in response thereto,
revealed that PNDT wing of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare was fully,
conscious about availability of such Sex Determination kits in the grey market.,
What was found to the satisfaction of the High Court was that Government,
itself was also worried and concerned about the same and had taken effective and,
adequate steps to block them and to create general awareness and sensitization,
"on the subject so that the laudable object and mission of the Government, as",
"Stated in its affidavit, to curb pre-natal sex selection and sex determination is",
realized.,
4,Vinod Soni v. Union of India [2005 CriLJ 3408]
In this case the validity of the Act was challenged on the ground that the provi-,
sions of the Act are violative of Article 21.,
An important argument of the Petitioner was that the right to life guaranteed,
under Article 21 of the Constitution includes right to personal liberty which in turns,
includes the liberty of choosing the sex of the offspring and to determine the nature,
of the family.,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,
,Women & the Reproductive Health Rights,433
The High Court however exposed the fallacy of this argument by observing,,
"that, “right to personal liberty cannot be expanded by any stretch of imagination to",,
prohibit the coming into existence of a female or male foetus which shall be for,,
nature to decide.”,,
"After making reference to the decisions of the Supreme Court, which explain",,
"that Article 21 includes the right to food, clothing, decent environment and even",,
"protection of cultural heritage, the High Court held that “these rights, even if,",,
further expanded to the extremes of the possible elasticity of the provisions of,,
"Article 21, cannot include right to selection of sex, whether pre-conception or",,
post-conception.”,,
5,M/s. Malpani Infertility Clinic Pvt. Ltd. & others v. Appropriate,
"Authority, PNDT Act & others [AIR 2005 Bom 26]",,
A Writ Petition was filed by M/s. Malpani Infertility Clinic Pvt. Ltd. in the High,,
"Court of Bombay, against the order passed by Appropriate Authority suspending",,
the registration of Petitioner’s Diagnostic Centre under the PCPNDT Act was,,
challenged.,,
"The main contention raised was that show cause notice, as contemplated (Sec-",,
"tion 20 (1)), an opportunity of hearing as contemplated (Section 20(2)) and suffi-",,
"cient reasons as required (Section 20(3)) under the Act, were not given to Peti-",,
tioners before taking the action of suspending registration; hence the order was,,
bad as per law.,,
"However, considering specific facts of the case, the High Court rejected this",,
contention. It was pointed out that Petitioners was one of the Respondent in Writ,,
Petition filed by CEHAT and had filed an affidavit therein defending the sex deter-,,
mination tests on the ground of ‘family balancing’. Though subsequently the Peti-,,
"tioners had filed another affidavit tendering apology, they knew that they were",,
prosecuted for criminal offence under the provisions of the Act.,,
"It was held that, as Appropriate Authority has, after referring to that criminal",,
"prosecution issued the order of suspension, there was sufficient notice to Petition-",,
ers and there was also sufficient mention of the reasons by the Appropriate Au-,,
"thority in suspension order. It was further held that, “when the reasons are re-",,
quired to be given in writing it is not necessary that there ought to be a detailed,,
discussion.”,,
6,Dr. Preetinder Kaur and others v. State of Punjab and others [2011,
Cri LJ 876],,
A Writ Petition was filed questioning the competency of the authority which,,
initiated criminal prosecution against the Petitioner for violation of Section 3(a),,
punishable under Section 23 of the Act.,,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,,
434,Women & the Reproductive Health Rights
It was contended that the Act contemplated the proceeding to be initiated in,
"particular fashion on a complaint by the Appropriate Authority, but the said proce-",
dure had not been followed. The person who had filed the complaint had never,
"been authorized by the Appropriate Authority for taking any action; therefore, the",
entire trial which was in progress before the Magistrate was vitiated.,
The High Court rightly rejected this contention by giving broader interpretation,
to Section 28 of the Act. It was held that Section 28 does not narrow down the,
"class of persons who can initiate action. On the other hand, as any legislation",
"intending to prevent a social evil, it allows for a fairly large body of persons to set",
the law in motion.,
7,Qualified Private Medical Practitioners and Hospitals Associations
v. State of Kerala [2006 (4) KarLJ 81],
The Court while considering the object of the Act and provisions under Sec-,
"tions 4(1) and 22 of the Act, it was held that, “Appropriate Authorities are com-",
"petent to ensure due compliance of the Act from all persons, at all places and at all",
"institutions, whether registered or unregistered under the Act, where the ultra-",
sound scanning device is installed.”,
8,Dr. Mrs. Suhasini Umesh Karanjakar v. Kolhapur Municipal Cor-
poration [2011(4) AIR Bom R 326],
While considering declining sex-ratio in Maharashtra from 913 in 2001 to 883,
"in 2011, the Court provided strict directions for expedite disposal of the pending",
"cases under the Act with utmost priority, preferably within one year.",
"The Court held that, words “any other material object” used in Section 30 of",
the Act and Explanation (2) to Rule 12 clearly provide that Appropriate Authority,
"is empowered to seize and seal ultra-sound machines, other machines and equip-",
ment capable of aiding or assisting in sex-selection.,

PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO,
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 1,
A married couple want to file a writ before the Court for the enforcement of,
"their right to personal liberty as a citizen of India, guaranteed under Article 21 of",
"the Constitution, which according to them includes the liberty of choosing the sex",
of the child. Is this argument valid?,
"Answer: No, the Right to Personal Liberty cannot be expanded by any stretch",
of imagination to prohibit the coming into existence of a female or male foetus,
"which shall be for nature to decide. These rights, even if, further expanded to the",
"extremes of the possible elasticity of the provisions of Article 21, cannot include",
"right to selection of sex, whether preconception or post-conception.",
***,
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 2,
A married couple having two female children and were desirous of having a,
"male child, filed a writ petition challenging the constitutionality of the PCPNDT",
Act on the ground that it violates principle of ‘equality of law’ enshrined in Article,
"14. According to them, the provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy",
"Act, 1972 (MTP Act), allows termination of pregnancy under certain circum-",
stances and hence there is no reason to impose a blanket ban on determination of,
sex at preconception stage. If anguish caused by unwanted pregnancy is recog-,
"nized as ground for termination of the pregnancy under MTP Act, why under",
PCPNDT Act anguish caused to a mother who conceives a female or male child,
for the second or third time is not considered and thus there is discrimination,
between two women situated in similar position and hence Act violates Article 14,
of the Constitution. Is the argument valid?,
"Answer: No, there can be no comparison between the two legislations: viz.,",
MTP Act and PCPNDT Act. The object of both the Acts differs. MTP Act does,
not deal with sex selection before or after conception. Anguish of a mother who,
does not want to bear a child of a particular sex cannot be equated with a mother,
who wants to terminate the pregnancy not because of the sex of child but for other,
circumstances. There is no question of discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of,
the Constitution.,
***,
PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 3,
An association of hospitals of a State had sought declaration that the laborato-,
ries and clinics which do not conduct pre-natal diagnostic tests using ultrasonog-,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,
436,Women & the Reproductive Health Rights
raphy will not come within the purview of the Act and the Authorities under the Act,
should not insist for registration of all ultrasound scanning centers irrespective of,
the fact as to whether they are conducting ultra-sonography or not.,
Answer: Though registration under the Act will be compulsory only for genetic,
"counseling centers, genetic clinics and genetic laboratories which are used for",
conducting any pre-natal diagnostic procedure or pre-diagnostic steps. But it does,
not mean that such clinics do not come within the purview of the provisions of the,
Act. Considering the Provisions of Section 4(1) and Section 22 of the Act and,
keeping in mind the object of the Act to prevent misuse of any pre-natal diagnostic,
"techniques, authorities are free to conduct inquiries or inspection at any place",
where such device is available and can take action under the Act in case any,
"person or institution is indulging in activities contrary to the provisions of the Act,",
irrespective of the fact that such an institute is registered or not under the Act.,
,***
,PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO. 4
An Infertility Clinic challenged the competency of the authority which initiated,
criminal prosecution against them for violation of Section 3(a) punishable under,
section 23 of the Act. It was contended that the Act contemplated the proceeding,
"to be initiated in particular fashion on a complaint by the Appropriate Authority,",
but the said procedure had not been followed. The person who had filed the,
complaint had never been authorized by the Appropriate Authority for taking any,
"action; therefore, the entire trial which was in progress before the Magistrate was",
vitiated. Are only competent persons allowed to file a complaint under the Act?,
"Answer: Yes, but a broader interpretation has been given to meaning of com-",
petent authority under Section 28 of the Act. In many cases it has been held by the,
Court that Section 28 does not narrow down the class of persons who can initiate,
"action. On the other hand, as any legislation intended to prevent a social evil, it",
allows for a fairly large body of persons to set the law in motion. Apart from the,
"Appropriate Authority, an Officer authorized by the Central or State Government",
can also file a complaint. He can also be a person authorized by the Appropriate,
"Authority itself. As per the Explanation contained under Section 28, the expres-",
sion ‘person’ includes even a social organization. The various categories of per-,
sons which are set out under Section 28 give authority to a wide range of persons,
who can initiate the action under the Act.,

PRACTICAL CASE SCENARIO NO: 5,
Dr. Seema issued a petition where she prayed for quashing of the FIR lodged,
against her under provisions of IPC read with the provisions of PCPNDT Act.,
The allegation in FIR was to the effect that in a sting operation shown on television,
it was revealed that Seema was engaged in performing abortions in her hospital in,
collusion with other doctors who determined the sex of the foetus by conducting,
ultrasound tests. Her contention was that no offence under the Act was disclosed,
as the FIR itself mentioned that sex determination of the woman had already been,
conducted elsewhere and she only agreed to perform the operation to terminate,
the pregnancy. Does the sex selection prohibition under the Act is only confined to,
sex determination?,
"Answer: No, a detailed consideration of the Object, Reasons and provisions of",
the Act makes it clear that sex selection prohibited under the Act cannot be con-,
fined only to the determination of the sex of foetus but includes all the steps taken,
by the person or by the specialist either himself or by any other person in facilitat-,
ing sex selection leading to elimination of female foetuses.,

Introduction,,
Women prisoners have many rights. They cannot be debarred from their basic,,
human rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of India. The Supreme,,
"Court in the case of Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration, AIR 1980 SC 1579 held",,
"that “whether inside prison or outside, a person shall not be deprived of his guar-",,
"anteed freedom save by methods ‘right, just and fair’”. There are several rights of",,
women prisoners which are provided by different committees appointed for prison,,
reforms by the United Nations. These rights must be incorporated in the Prison,,
"Act, 1894. Since Prisons is a State subject under Entry 4 of the State Subjects",,
List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India.,,
"As per the State List provided in the Seventh Schedule of Indian Constitution,",,
"all issues related to prisons, reformatories, and institutions of a like nature, and",,
persons detained therein; arrangements with other States for the use of prisons,,
and other institutions come under the domain of State Governments. The rules of,,
incarceration are determined by following laws:,,

"The offences and their punishments have been given under Indian Penal Code,",,

"in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred as Cr.P.C.). Under",,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,,
448,,Women in Custody,,,
"Cr.P.C., the offences have been mainly classified under two heads- bailable and",,,,,
non-bailable offences,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,OWhat is an offence?
,,Any act which is deemed as an offence by any law is an offence. Any act which,,,
causes a violation of the rights of others or causes harm to others and is so danger-,,,,,
ous that also affects the society at large is designated as offence. Section 2(n) of,,,,,
Cr.P.C. defines an offence as: “Offence” means any act or omission made punish-,,,,,
able by any law for the time being in force and includes any act in respect of which,,,,,
a complaint may be made.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ What is Bail?,ｏ,ｏ
,,Bail is an instrument which is used to ensure the presence of an accused when-,,,
"ever required by the court. Cr.P.C. does not define the term Bail, but essentially,",,,,,
Bail is an agreement in which an accused person makes a written undertaking to,,,,,
the court to appear before it whenever required and comply with any conditions,,,,,
set out in the agreement. He/she also assures to forfeit a specified sum of money if,,,,,
the person fails to comply with any terms and conditions of the agreement.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ What do you mean by bailable and non-bailable offences?,ｏ,ｏ
,,Section 2(a) of Cr.P.C. defines bailable offences as the offence that has been,,,
shown in the First Schedule as bailable or which is made bailable by any other law,,,,,
for the time being in force. The first schedule of the Cr.P.C. is divided into two,,,,,
parts wherein the first part deals with the offences given under IPC and the second,,,,,
part deals with the offences under other laws. As per the last item of the First,,,,,
"Schedule, an offence in order to be bailable would have to be an offence which is",,,,,
punishable with imprisonment for less than three years or with fine only.,,,,,
,,"Some of the common bailable offences are: Simple Hurt (Section 337, IPC),",,,
"Bribery (Section 171-E, IPC), Public Nuisance (Section 290, IPC), Death by",,,,,
"Rash or Negligent Act (Section 304-A, IPC).",,,,,
,,"Section 2(a) of Cr.P.C., non-bailable offence includes all those offences which",,,
"are not included in bailable offence in the First Schedule. Further, the First Sched-",,,,,
ule in its Second part at its end has defined non-bailable offence as the offences,,,,,
"which are punishable with death, imprisonment of life or imprisonment for more",,,,,
than seven years.,,,,,

,,Women in Custody,449,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ What is the right to be released on bail?,O,ｏ
,,"Section 50 of Cr.P.C. whenever a person is arrested without warrant, it is the",,,
duty of the police officer to communicate the full detail of the offence for which the,,,,,
"person is arrested. Also, if the offence for which the person is arrested is a bailable",,,,,
"one, it is the duty of the police to inform that he is entitled to be released on bail",,,,,
after giving surety.,,,,,
,,"As per Section 436 of Cr.P.C., whenever a person accused of a bailable of-",,,
"fence is arrested without warrant and is prepared to give bail, such person shall be",,,,,
released on bail. The discretion to decide the bail amount is with the Court or with,,,,,
the officer.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ,ｏHow to obtain bail or Procedure for bail?
,,"In order to apply for a bail in the case of a bailable offence, the person needs to",,,
"fill a form of bail i.e., Form No. 45 which is given in the first schedule and apply for",,,,,
bail and the Court will have to grant bail.,,,,,
,ｏ,ｏ,ｏ How can I get bail in a non-bailable offence?,ｏ,ｏ
,,A person accused of a non-bailable offence doesn’t have right to be released,,,
"on bail, but the bail can be granted at the discretion of the court, subject to certain",,,,,
conditions given in Section 437 of Cr.P.C..,,,,,
,,If a person is arrested on accusation of commission of any non-bailable of-,,,
"fence, then the person will not be released on bail if there appears a reasonable",,,,,
ground that the person is guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprison-,,,,,
ment of life. A person accused with an offence punishable with death or impris-,,,,,
onment of life can be released on bail if the person is below the age of sixteen,,,,,
"years. If at any stage of investigation, it appears to the Court that there are",,,,,
reasonable grounds for believing that the person has not committed a non-bail-,,,,,
"able offence, the person may be released on bail at the discretion of Court on",,,,,
execution of a bond.,,,,,
,,In a case a person is accused with commission or abetment or conspiracy or,,,
attempt to commit any offence against state or with offences affecting human body,,,,,
"or with offences against property may be released on bail, but the Court may",,,,,
impose conditions that it deems necessary in order to ensure that the person shall,,,,,
Attend the Court in accordance with the conditions of the bond executed.,,,,,

ters where information regarding the arrest and the place of custody of the ar-,
"restee shall be communicated by the officer causing the arrest, within 12 hours of",
effecting the arrest and at the police control room it should be displayed on a,
conspicuous notice board.,
2. Nandani Satpathy v. P. L. Dani [AIR 1978 SC 1025],
The court held that the right not to make self-incriminatory statements should,
be widely interpreted to cover the pre-trial stage of police investigation. It also,
criticized the police for calling women to police investigations. It also criticized the,
police for calling women to police stations for investigation saying this constitute a,
"violation of Section 160 (1) of the Cr.P.C, which requires the police to interview",
males under 15 and women in the places where they reside.,
3. Sheela Barse v. State of Maharashtra [AIR 1983 SC 378],
The Supreme Court in Sheela Barse v. State of Maharashtra devised number,
of guidelines to ensure protection of woman prisoners:-,
i. We would direct that four or five police lock-ups should be selected in rea-,
sonably good localities where only female suspects should be kept and they should,
be guarded by female constables. Female suspects should not be kept in a police,
lock-up in which male suspects are detained.,
ii. We would further direct that interrogation of females should be carried out,
only in the presence of female police officers/constables.,
"iii. Whenever a person is arrested by the police without warrant, he must be",
immediately informed of the grounds of his arrest and in case of every arrest it,
must immediately be made known to the arrested person that he is entitled to,
apply for bail.,
"iv. We would direct that as soon as a person is arrested, the police must imme-",
diately obtain from him the name of any relative or friend whom he would like to,

"thority and process of law. The District Judge, Agra who carries out monthly",
inspection of the Protective Home shall verify during every visit that no woman or,
girl is detained except under the authority of law and if he finds that any of them is,
Knowledge Partner : All India Reporter Pvt. Ltd.,
Women in Custody,463
"detained without any authority of law, he shall take steps to see that she is released",
and repatriated to her parents or husband or other proper authority. Supreme,
"court also directed the State Government to set up, within a period of two weeks",
"from the receipt of this Order, a Board of Visitors on which there shall be at least",
three social activists working in the field of welfare of women and particularly,
suppression of immoral traffic in women and there shall also be included in the,
Board of Visitors two persons to be nominated by the District Judge.,
5. Christian Community Welfare Council of India and another v. Gov-,

one friend relative or other person who is known to him or likely to take an,
interest in his welfare told as far as is practicable that he has been arrested,
and where is being detained.,
ii. The Police Officer shall inform the arrested person when he is brought to the,
police station of this right.,
iii. An entry shall be required to be made in the Diary as to who was informed of,
the arrest.,
These protections from power must be held to flow from Articles. 21 and,
22(1) and enforced strictly. The court observed that the object would be served if,
a direction was issued to the arresting authority that while arresting a female per-,
"son, all efforts should be made to keep a lady constable present.",

ix. Diet: Dietary scale for institutionalized infants/children prepared by Dr. A.M.,
"Dwarkadas Motiwala, MD (Paediatrics) and Fellowship in Neonatology",
(USA) has been submitted by Mr. Sanjay Parikh. The document submitted,
recommends exclusive breastfeeding on the demand of the baby day and,
"night. If for some reason, the mother cannot feed the baby, undiluted fresh",
milk can be given to the baby. It is emphasized that “dilution is not recom-,
"mended; especially for low socio-economic groups who are also illiterate,",
"ignorant, their children are already malnourished and are prone to gastroen-",
teritis and other infections due to poor living conditions and unhygienic food,
"habits. Also, where the drinking water is not safe/reliable since source of",
drinking water is a question mark. Over-dilution will provide more water,
than milk to the child and hence will lead to malnutrition and infections. This,
in turn will lead to growth retardation and developmental delay both physi-,
cally and mentally.” It is noted that since an average Indian mother produces,
approximately 600 800 ml. milk per day (depending on her own nutritional,
"state), the child should be provided at least 600 ml. of undiluted fresh milk",
over 24 hours if the breast milk is not available. The report also refers to the,
